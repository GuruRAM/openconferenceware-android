Before we can focus on presenting the content, we have to figure out how to normalize existing content, create and maintain new content, and deliver the content for consumption by whatever presentation technology we plan to use.  Fortunately for us, many tools that are designed to solve these problems on the Web are also very suitable for delivering content to kiosks, interactive tables, or more exotic interactive installations.\r\n\r\nWe have chosen to use the \"symfony framework\":http://www.symfony-project.org/.  Symfony is a full-stack web framework for PHP.  One of its features is a powerful system for creating administrative interfaces based on your database model.  This system is easy enough to create useful admin tools almost immediately using only yaml-based config files, while remaining flexible enough to allow for significant customization when necessary.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I provide a high-level overview of symfony and the symfony admin generator in the context of museum installations.  Throughout the session I'll use real-world examples of kiosks and interactive tables we've created for museums such as the Walt Disney Family Museum, the GRAMMY Museum, and the Gettysburg National Park Museum and Visitor Center.  I'll cover the following topics:\r\n\r\n# The often messy world of museum content, and how symfony helps us unify and normalize disparate content sources\r\n# Creating custom admin tools with the symfony admin generator\r\n# Using symfony to create RESTful web services which can deliver content to your presentation layer in a variety of formats\r\n\r\nThis session will assume some familiarity with object-oriented programming in PHP5, but will be light on code.

We'll cover alternate types of augmented reality techniques and how they have been saving us time in the past few months. We'll demonstrate how we've been merging available technologies with custom programming to create location-aware social networks with custom proximity notification. Finally, we'll describe other uses for location sharing, such as automatically turning off house lights when leaving for work, and wayfinding with piezoelectric buzzers.

Nobody wants to help anyone.\r\n\r\nDevelopers often treat bug reports like the user dumped a bag of crap on their doorstep, rang the bell and told them to clean it up.  That's not what they are.  A bug report is a user walking up to your door, stepping in crap, pointing out maybe it should be cleaned up.\r\n\r\nNobody likes stepping in crap.  And nobody likes cleaning it up.  So the whole interaction starts off on the wrong foot, perhaps the one covered in crap.  Your job, as developer or as reporter, is to deliberately steer it back to being a positive one where the developer wants to fix your bug and the reporter wants to continue to report bugs.\r\n\r\nAs a user, and as a developer, some simple social hacks will turn bug reporting from a hateful shoutfest into a pleasant collaboration.  We'll look at some dos and don'ts when reporting and receiving a bug, how to provide enough information, avoid a hostile tone, make it easy to report and track bugs, and how to keep your head when all you really want to do is bash someone's in.\r\n\r\nAs a developer, you'll encourage more and better quality feedback from your users and even pick up new developers in the process.  As a user, developers will find your reports so delightful they'll enjoy patching it.

The next step was to build software to interface with the wireless sensors and capture the data that they were sending. The interface software (called XBeeLib) uses Apache Mina as a major component to handle translation of packets to and from the wireless modules. The monitoring software (called pHomeNet) is a Java-based system running on the Apache Felix OSGi container. Observations from the sensors are recorded into a database (Apache Derby by default). Although the system is currently focused on recording temperature sensor data, it could easily be adapted to record data from other sensors or even to control devices based on sensor inputs.

At university, a student attends many classes all on different topics, but only has to learn one hour of material per class per day. At a conference, an attendee may sit through many hours of interesting talks, but they have the freedom to choose how much they participate in each. In an intensive training course, a student has to learn, understand and fully absorb 6 hours of material on the same topic, every day for several days in a row. Worse, each of these hours builds on the one before; requiring a level of alertness and participation not usually needed at educational institutions, conferences or in the workplace.\r\n\r\nMake your training experience truly stand out by structuring it to help alleviate burn-out. These techniques are essential for a multi-day training course, but will provide you with a solid background for single or even half-day sessions as well.\r\n\r\nThis talk will describe what Perl Training Australia has learned about course structure for technical courses involving lots of hands-on programming exercises.

PHP is a scripting language with dynamic, weak typing. C++ is a compiled language with static typing. While PHP allows you to write magical dynamic features, most PHP is relatively straightforward. It's more likely that you see if (...) {...} else {..} than it is to see function foo($x) { include $x; }. This is where we gain in performance. Whenever possible our generated code uses static binding for functions and variables. We also use type inference to pick the most specific type possible for our variables and thus save memory.\r\n\r\nThe transformation process includes three main steps:\r\n\r\n1. Static analysis where we collect information on who declares what and dependencies,\r\n2. Type inference where we choose the most specific type between C++ scalars, String, Array, classes, Object, and Variant, and\r\n3. Code generation, which for the most part is a direct correspondence from PHP statements and expressions to C++ statements and expressions.\r\n\r\nWe have also developed HPHPi, which is an experimental interpreter designed for development. When using HPHPi you don't need to compile your PHP source code before running it. It's helped us catch bugs in HipHop itself and provides engineers a way to use HipHop without changing how they write PHP.\r\n\r\nOverall HipHop allows us to keep the best aspects of PHP while taking advantage of the performance benefits of C++. In total, we have written over 300,000 lines of code and more than 5,000 unit tests. All of this will be released this evening on GitHub under the open source PHP license.\r\n", "affiliation": null, "start_time": "2010-06-03T14:30:00-07:00", "biography": null, "presenter": null}, {"room_title": "Fremont", "room_id": 11, "session_type_id": 5, "event_title": "2010", "end_time": "2010-06-03T15:15:00-07:00", "created_at": "2010-03-25T20:55:50-07:00", "event_id": 2011, "title": "Sphinx - the ultimate tool for documenting your software project", "submitted_at": "2010-03-25T20:55:50-07:00", "updated_at": "2010-05-15T14:39:06-07:00", "user_titles": ["Nate Aune"], "user_ids": [285], "id": 432, "track_title": "Cooking", "track_id": 9, "user_id": null, "website": null, "session_type_title": "Short Form", "description": "Sphinx makes documenting your project almost too easy.\r\n\r\nYou can even integrate your documentation with your code in that your documentation can be run as a test, and your class and function docstrings can become your reference documentation. \r\n\r\nMarkup as well-designed as reStructuredText is not only a lot of fun to use, but it also very cleanly separates content from design.
