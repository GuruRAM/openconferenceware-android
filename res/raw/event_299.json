{"description": "\n<p>The emergence of many low-cost, off-the shelf boards supporting embedded Linux (or <span class=\"caps\">BSD</span>) opens a wealth of possibilities for the hacker willing to expand her horizons to the possibilities of hardware tinkering.</p>\n<p>Using the lowest amount of custom hardware and pouring Perl and Shell Script over everything as the glue binding it all, we create two minimalistic devices delivering a perfectly tuned network time source (synchronizing with a <span class=\"caps\">GPS</span> satellite), and a naturally random entropy source (leveraging a Geiger tube&#8217;s measurement of natural background radiation).</p>\n<p>The sample designs provide an entertaining introduction to the skills needed to design basic embedded systems, and their unavoidable <span class=\"caps\">BIOS</span> and operating system underpinnings.</p>\n<p>Aimed to medium-to-advanced Administrators, and Developers not shying away from the gory details of how Linux works behind the scenes. Come play, it is fun on the hardware side!</p>\n", "title": "Hardware Hacking 101", "start_time": "2010-07-23T10:00:00-07:00", "track_id": 12, "user_ids": [293], "room_id": 19, "end_time": "2010-07-23T10:40:00-07:00", "id": 299}
