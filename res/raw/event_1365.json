{"description": "\n<p>MySQL users have an insatiable need for speed, capacity, and availability, all at a reasonable cost.   This session will provide technical overview of the approach that Schooner engineering took to optimize MySQL Enterprise and InnoDB with flash memory, multi-core processors, and <span class=\"caps\">DRAM</span> to achieve an 8x improvement in performance relative to existing systems.</p>\n<p>This session will provide a crash course in the performance tuning tools and techniques that Schooner used to radically improve MySQL performance on commodity hardware.  It will also offer an overview of the results that were achieved, and compare these results to other commonly deployed MySQL server architectures, including stock MySQL on SSDs and Fusion-io, using the industry-standard <span class=\"caps\">DBT2</span> benchmark.</p>\n<p><strong>Sponsored by Schooner Information Technology</strong></p>\n", "title": "MySQL Bottleneck Hunters \u2013 How Schooner Increased MySQL Performance by 8x", "start_time": "2010-07-22T11:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 23, "user_ids": [1383], "room_id": 22, "end_time": "2010-07-22T12:10:00-07:00", "id": 1365}
