{"description": "\n<p>Can Open Source save the world &#8230; or at least the part of it we call K-12 education? Schools all over the U.S. are desperately seeking ways to provide students with technology education, collaborative team skills and experience with real world problems.  This comes at a time when school must justify every dollar spent.  From <span class=\"caps\">UDL</span> to differentiated learning, the Open Source community and its collaborative, cross-cultural method of creating software, hardware and data is a natural model for the requested transformation of U.S. K-12 schools.  Schools are slowly recognizing the value of integrating <span class=\"caps\">FOSS</span> solutions and methods but if the Open Source community <em>actively</em> reached out to schools, the transformation might happen a generation earlier.</p>\n<p>This talk is targeted at <span class=\"caps\">FOSS</span> project leaders and community members and will explain how our skills, knowledge and experience can be invaluable to educators in our home towns.   Linux is definitely ready for the desktop.   It is just a smaller desk than we expected.</p>\n", "title": "Can Open Source Save The World...?", "start_time": "2010-07-21T14:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 21, "user_ids": [138], "room_id": 19, "end_time": "2010-07-21T15:10:00-07:00", "id": 153}
