{"description": "\n<p>This talk will introduce <a href=\"http://www.concurrency.cc/\">Plumbing</a>, a set of tools to support artists and makers in the programming of low-cost, open-hardware platforms like the <a href=\"http://www.arduino.cc/\">Arduino</a>. Plumbing is a library of parallel components written in <a href=\"http://www.occam-pi.org/\">occam-pi</a>, a small language with a long history. <a href=\"http://www.erlang.se/\">Erlang</a>, <a href=\"http://clojure.org/\">Clojure</a>, <a href=\"http://golang.org/\">Go</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.xmos.com/technology/design-tools\"><span class=\"caps\">XMOS XC</span></a> programming language all draw from the linguistic traditions pioneered three decades ago by occam-pi.</p>\n<p>Our talk will explore parallel programming with Plumbing through a sequence of programs, each six lines or less. We will start by blinking lights in parallel, show how we can respond to  unpredictable sensory input from the world around us, and close with a demonstration of distributed programming. Each of these activities helps illustrate and make accessible a fundamental pattern of parallelism.</p>\n<p>We will close with a brief discussion of our initial research regarding the usability of Plumbing by novice programmers, and how those results will help guide the future development of our tools.</p>\n", "title": "Plumbing: Parallel Programming for Artists and Makers", "start_time": "2010-07-21T16:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 12, "user_ids": [1029, 1035], "room_id": 9, "end_time": "2010-07-21T17:10:00-07:00", "id": 1011}
