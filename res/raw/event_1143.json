{"description": "\n<p>Mirah (formerly Duby), is a Ruby-inspired, statically-typed, lightweight,\nplatform-agnostic language with backends for <span class=\"caps\">JVM</span> bytecode, Java\nsource, and more platforms planned. It borrows features from several\nstatic and dynamic languages, but with a twist: no runtime dependency\non any additional library; everything is done at compile time. This\nmakes Mirah more suitable as a &#8220;javac&#8221; replacement than any other\nmainstream <span class=\"caps\">JVM</span> language, and will allow Mirah to be used anywhere Java\n(or its other backends) can be used. I&#8217;ll discuss design goals,\nstatus, futures, and show examples.</p>\n", "title": "Mirah", "start_time": "2010-07-21T17:20:00-07:00", "track_id": 2, "user_ids": [1161], "room_id": 33, "end_time": "2010-07-21T17:40:00-07:00", "id": 1143}
