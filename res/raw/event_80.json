{"description": "\n<p>This will be a hands-on session, with multiple presenters. We will cover JavaScript best practices, a bit of the history of how and why JS frameworks came about, and tell a few cautionary tales of anti-patterns (common jQuery mistakes).</p>\n<p>Attendees will be expected to have a basic understanding of <span class=\"caps\">HTML</span> and <span class=\"caps\">CSS</span>, and it will be helpful if they have at least dabbled a bit with jQuery. We will take them the rest of the way, helping them delve into the framework, understanding more about how it works, thereby removing some of the mysticism around how jQuery works its magic.</p>\n", "title": "Cooking with jQuery", "start_time": "2010-07-20T13:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 20, "user_ids": [62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67], "room_id": 5, "end_time": "2010-07-20T17:00:00-07:00", "id": 80}
