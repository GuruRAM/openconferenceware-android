{"description": "\n<p>This talk will detail the need for frameworks designed for the semantic web and show how to build applications with CubicWeb.</p>\n<p>After creating a network of computers, then a network of documents, we moved to the web where the amount of data available keeps growing and where there is a need to link data together instead of documents. And that&#8217;s what the semantic web is about. CubicWeb provides a framework to ease the development of semantic web applications, meaning consuming semantic data from the web and providing semantic data to the web.\nWe&#8217;ll explain in this talk what features we need in a framework to easily build an application that will be part of the web of data.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll insist on the fact that CubicWeb is made of two parts, the web engine and the data repository, and that the repository can be used without the web engine. This will be demonstrated with a TurboGears application that used the CubicWeb repository as its persistence layer. <span class=\"caps\">RQL</span> (Relationship Query Language) in TurboGears!</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll see how a schema is enough to generate a <span class=\"caps\">CRUD</span> user interface and how from there we can start customizing the interface by developing views and publish semantic data.</p>\n<p>We will also present examples of integration within the Linked Data cloud, and\nwith Google Maps, and also present an example of faceted search.</p>\n<p>This talk has a lot of material to cover so 45 minutes is more adapted, but it could fit into a 30 minutes talk if the schedule requires it.</p>\n", "title": "CubicWeb - The Semantic Web is a Construction Game!", "start_time": "2010-07-22T17:20:00-07:00", "track_id": 5, "user_ids": [274], "room_id": 10, "end_time": "2010-07-22T18:00:00-07:00", "id": 281}
