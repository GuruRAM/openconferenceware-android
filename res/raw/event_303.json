{"description": "\n<p>Google App Engine is Google&#8217;s exciting application development and hosting platform in the cloud. With it, you can build &#38; deploy web applications on Google&#8217;s scalable high-traffic infrastructure. App Engine supports apps written in Python or Java, and they will execute on servers that use the same technology that powers Google&#8217;s websites for speed and reliability. There is no need to think about virtual machine images, databases, or disk requirements&#8230; you just provide the source. There is no &#8220;lock-in&#8221; because you still own your code, and can port it to a standard <span class=\"caps\">LAMP</span> stack if necessary using existing web technologies like Django and Groovy.</p>\n<p>App Engine applications are easy to build and scale as your traffic and data storage needs grow. With App Engine, there are no servers to maintain: You just upload your application, and it&#8217;s ready to serve your users. There is a generous free quota, and if you think you may need more, can enable billing which gives you additional free quota. You only pay for what you use beyond that. There are no set-up costs and no recurring fees. You control the maximum amounts of resources your app can consume, so it always stays within your budget.</p>\n<p>This talk introduces you to the architecture and core components of Google App Engine, including some of its most popular developer APIs, such as memcache, User (Google accounts), email, URLFetch, <span class=\"caps\">XMPP</span>, Blobstore, etc. In the hands-on lab, we&#8217;ll go through a simple example using Python. We&#8217;ll build and deploy a real app to the cloud in minutes! Although knowing Python and web programming may be helpful, it is not required.</p>\n", "title": "Introduction to Google App Engine", "start_time": "2010-07-20T08:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 13, "user_ids": [315], "room_id": 7, "end_time": "2010-07-20T12:00:00-07:00", "id": 303}
