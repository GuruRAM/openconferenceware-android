{"description": "\n<p>The Parrot virtual machine hit 2.0 in January of this year, and the 2.6 production release will be out the day before this talk. A virtual machine like no other, Parrot targets dynamic languages such as Perl, Ruby, Python and <span class=\"caps\">PHP</span>. It incorporates an object-oriented assembly language, is register-based rather than stack-based, and employs continuations as the core means of flow control. This talk explores the overall architecture of Parrot and hints to the future ahead from the lessons we&#8217;ve learned.</p>\n", "title": "Parrot", "start_time": "2010-07-21T13:40:00-07:00", "track_id": 2, "user_ids": [15], "room_id": 33, "end_time": "2010-07-21T14:00:00-07:00", "id": 855}
