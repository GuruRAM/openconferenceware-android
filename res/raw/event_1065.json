{"description": "\n<p>This presentation uses the Milton Bradley &#8220;Game of Life&#8221; as a metaphor for creating and running a business based on open source software.</p>\n<p>It starts with how to decide what type of company to form (traditional or foundation), the importance of license choice as well as when to quit the day job.</p>\n<p>The special needs and advantages of open source are discussed, from copyright issues to community management. Also, emphasis is placed on the fact that an open source business is still a <strong>business</strong> with issues such as accounting, taxes and other paper work.</p>\n<p>It then moves into issues concerning products, customer management and employees. Finally, it ends with exit strategies, whether it involved investment, an acquisition or simply creating a business with a lot of longevity.</p>\n", "title": "So, You Think You Want to Start an Open Source Business?", "start_time": "2010-07-21T16:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 24, "user_ids": [1089], "room_id": 14, "end_time": "2010-07-21T17:10:00-07:00", "id": 1065}
