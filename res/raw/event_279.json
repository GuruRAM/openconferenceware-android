We examine what cloud computing means, its past, the future and the interaction with open source. The purpose of this track is to give the audience a sound understanding of the issues around cloud computing, to sort fact from fiction, to dispel some of the myths around cloud and to provide a common framework to understand what is happening in our industry.</p>\n<p>The summit combines experts from the field of operation, security, enterprise architecture, technology change and open source as well as practitioners in the field of cloud computing to give a holistic view of cloud computing \u2013 today and tomorrow.</p>\n<p>After the event, come and socialize with some of the leading lights of cloud computing and then join us for the <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/14686\">O\u2019Reilly Open Source Awards</a> and <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/14332\">Ignite <span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span></a>, a fast-paced and fun evening of talks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.oreilly.com/oscon2010/public/register\">Register now</a> for the Cloud Summit, or the Cloud Summit plus the full O\u2019Reilly Open Source Convention (21-23 July).</p>\n<h3>Who Should Attend?</h3>\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; CIOs, CTOs, Technical Architects and those wishing to get up to speed quickly with concepts of cloud computing.<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Practitioners and evangelists in the field wishing to understand where cloud computing is heading.<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Community leaders &#38; local event organisers in the cloud computing space<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Open source community leaders<br/>\n<br/>\n<h3>Benefits of Attending</h3>\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Gain an understanding of what cloud really means and where it is heading.<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Hear directly from key figures in the cloud computing industry.<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Share with others using cloud computing in practice.<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Build connections with local events and groups in cloud computing.<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Build connections with other companies using cloud computing.<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Find developers or employers with cloud computing experience<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>We want attendees to the Cloud Summit to get the most benefit from being together.

Is it just a technology problem or are there management considerations? Are enterprises adopted cloud, is the cloud ready for them and are they ready for it?</p>\n<p><strong>9:10am &#8211; 9:30am</strong> <br /><a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/14861\u2028\">Security, Identity &#8211; Back to the Drawing Board?</a>\n<br /><i>Subra Kumaraswamy</i>\n<br />Is much of the cloud security debate simply <span class=\"caps\">FUD</span> or are there some real consequences of this change?</p>\n<p><strong>9:30am &#8211; 9:50am</strong> <br /><a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/14862\">Cloudy Operations</a>\n<br /><i>John Willis</i>\n<br />In the cloud world new paradigms and memes are appearing :- the rise of the \u201cDevOps\u201d, \u201cInfrastructure == Code\u201d and \u201cDesign for Failure\u201d. Given that cloud is fundamentally about volume operations of a commoditized activity, operations become a key battleground for competitive efficiency. Automation and orchestration appear key areas for the future development of the cloud. We review current thinking and who is leading this change.</p>\n<p><strong>9:50am &#8211; 10:10am</strong> <br /> <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/14863\">The Cloud Myths, Schemes and Dirty Little Secrets</a>\n<br /><i>Patrick Kerpan</i>\n<br />The cloud is surrounded by many claims but how many of these stand up to scrutiny. How many are based on fact or are simply wishful thinking? Is cloud computing green, will it save you money, will it lead to faster rates of innovation? We explore this subject and look at the dirty little secrets that no-one wants to tell you.</p>\n<p><strong>10:10am &#8211; 10:30am</strong> <br /><a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/14864\">Curing Addiction is Easier</a>\n<br /><i>Stephen O\u2019Grady</i>\n<br />Since Douglas Parkhill first introduced us to the idea of competitive markets of compute utilities back in the 1960s, the question has always been when would this occur? However, is a competitive marketplace in the interests of everyone and do providers want easy switching? We examine the issue of standards and portability in the cloud.</p>\n<p><strong>10:30am &#8211; 11:00am Break</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Future Thinking</strong> In this section we hear from leading visionaries on the trends they see occurring in the cloud and the connection and relationships to other changes in our industry.</p>\n<p><strong>11:00am &#8211; 11:30am</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/14865\">The Future of the Cloud</a>\n<br /><i>J.P.

The Role of Open Source in Creating Competitive Markets</a>\n<br /><i>Rick Clark</i>\n<br />How will open source help create competitive markets?
