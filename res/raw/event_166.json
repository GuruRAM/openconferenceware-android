{"description": "\n<p><em>Non-relational databases</em></p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s web applications require enormous scalability and performance. This has spurred the growth of a new class of databases that trade off some of the features of relational databases to offer high performance, ease of programming, high availability and the ability to scale in cloud environments. They are collectively called NoSQL or non-relational databases.</p>\n<p><em>Overview of MongoDB</em></p>\n<p>MongoDB (from &#8220;humongous&#8221;) is a high-performance, open source, schema-free document-oriented database. Trading off a few traditional features of databases (notably joins and transactions) in order to achieve much better performance, MongoDB is fast, scalable, and designed for web development.
