{"description": "\n<p>The OpenCV library is a collection of routines intended for real-time computer vision, released under the <span class=\"caps\">BSD</span> License, free for both private and commercial use. The library has a number of different possible applications including object recognition and tracking.</p>\n<p>This talk will walk attendees through the cross-compiling and building a static distribution of the library which you can link to your application and make use of from both the iPhone Simulator and the iPhone (and iPod touch) device itself.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll then go on a discuss how to use the OpenCV library to build a simple application to perform face recognition on images taken directly using the iPhone&#8217;s own camera.</p>\n<p>This presentation is an walks the attendees through cross-compiling and building the OpenCV  library for the iPhone. It assumes some experience with programming the iPhone and with Objective-C, and experience with the command line build tools. Previous experience cross-compiling for code for multiple platforms is not required. It would suit experience iPhone developers.</p>\n", "title": "Face Detection on the iPhone ", "start_time": "2010-07-21T14:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 6, "user_ids": [144], "room_id": 12, "end_time": "2010-07-21T15:10:00-07:00", "id": 158}
