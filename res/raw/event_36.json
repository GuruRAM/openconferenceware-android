{"description": "\n<p>DTrace is a comprehensive dynamic tracing framework. It provides a powerful infrastructure to enable administrators, developers, and service personnel to concisely answer arbitrary questions about the behavior applications at runtime. DTrace can be used to observe applications written in Java, C, C++ <span class=\"caps\">PHP</span> Ruby, Python and much more.</p>\n<p>This Hands-on Lab has something for everyone. It will including DTrace fundamentals for those that are new to it. We will learn how to use DTrace to observe scripting languages. A typical <span class=\"caps\">AMP</span> stack application will be observed and optimized. For experienced DTrace users, it discusses creating user-land statically defined tracing (USDT) probes in Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE platform) release 7.0 applications. For the superadvanced, the presentation covers using the Java technology-based and C APIs for DTrace.</p>\n", "title": "Observing and Optimizing your Application with DTrace", "start_time": "2010-07-19T08:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 3, "user_ids": [21], "room_id": 12, "end_time": "2010-07-19T12:00:00-07:00", "id": 36}
