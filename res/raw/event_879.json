{"description": "\n<p>The Simple Cloud <span class=\"caps\">API</span> is a project sponsored by several leading vendors (Zend, Go Grid, <span class=\"caps\">IBM</span>, Microsoft, Nirvanix and Rackspace). In this session we&#8217;ll take a look at how to use the <span class=\"caps\">API</span> to access different kinds of cloud services in an open, flexible way.</p>\n<p>Most cloud APIs require programmers to think about arcane details instead of business logic. The Simple Cloud <span class=\"caps\">API</span> lets you write one application that runs with multiple cloud vendors, despite the differences in their APIs. This session will show you how to use it to write elegant, flexible, business-oriented code that insulates your application from the APIs and wire formats underneath.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll wrap up the session with a discussion of how you can add support for other providers by implementing the Simple Cloud <span class=\"caps\">API</span> yourself.</p>\n", "title": "Building Applications with the Simple Cloud API", "start_time": "2010-07-21T14:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 13, "user_ids": [879], "room_id": 5, "end_time": "2010-07-21T15:10:00-07:00", "id": 879}
