{"description": "\n<p>Open64 is an open-source C/C++ and Fortran compiler suite designed for high performance workloads.  Open64 is interoperable with gcc.  The x86 Open64 compiler system offers a high level of advanced optimizations, multi-threading and processor support that includes global optimization, vectorization, interprocedural analysis, feedback directed optimizations, loop transformations and code generation tuned for x86/x86_64.  During the <span class=\"caps\">BOF</span>, we summarize Open64 capabilities, highlight recent improvements and welcome user input on further improvements.  About half the time will be spent in organized presentation and other half in feedback and discussion.</p>\n", "title": "Open64 Compiler", "start_time": "2010-07-21T19:00:00-07:00", "track_id": 14, "user_ids": [2091], "room_id": 22, "end_time": "2010-07-21T20:00:00-07:00", "id": 2067}
