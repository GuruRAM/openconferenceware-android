Follow along as a\nPerl developer shows you how to learn enough of the blackberry platform\nstart offering an on-device experience to your BlackBerry users.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll start off by working through how to get enough of a development \nenvironment set up.  We&#8217;ll look at what you can use on a Mac or Linux \nand what you really need to boot up Windows to do, and the pitfalls this\ncauses.</p>\n<p>Then we&#8217;ll work through what Java features you can actually use (sorry \nfolks, no generics here) and some of the fun pitfalls that await you the\nfirst time you try to start an app on the device.  We&#8217;ll also look at \nthe level of difficulty involved in a simple http request and what to do\nonce you finally have access to your <span class=\"caps\">API</span> and user data.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll end with a quick look at things you need to consider when\ndeveloping for users who are used to a trackball and keyboard rather\nthan the full touch experience.</p>\n", "title": "BlackBerry development for Web Application Developers", "start_time": "2010-07-22T17:20:00-07:00", "track_id": 6, "user_ids": [277], "room_id": 12, "end_time": "2010-07-22T18:00:00-07:00", "id": 284}
