{"description": "\r\n\t\t  The condition of America&#8217;s voting systems is well known: <em>only two major vendors remain</em> with solutions that are <em>black box</em> and <em>proprietary</em>, and there is little assurance of accuracy, transparency, trust, or security.  The <strong>TrustTheVote Project</strong> is a groundbreaking effort comprised of four big ideas: \n\t\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Elections systems should be publicly owned, open source, and transparent;<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; The only way to achieve accuracy, transparency, trust, and security is to engage stakeholders in a community effort to drive the requirements and specifications for a system framework that can be tailored to each jurisdiction;<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Such a system must be designed and built as a series of independent &#8220;lightweight&#8221; single-purpose components and not a single monolithic system; and<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Such a system, despite the capabilities of digital innovation, must produce a paper record of the cast ballot and transparent audit loops for the entire process.<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>This session provides an overview of an imperative public digital works project: an established effort to re-invent how America votes in a digital democracy. Its <strong>not</strong> <em>online voting</em>, but it <em>is</em> rebuilding America\u2019s voting systems infrastructure into an <strong>open source</strong>, <strong>publicly owned</strong> platform.  It is an imperative project for us all, because <em><strong>how</strong></em> America votes has become just as important as <em><strong>who</strong></em> America votes for.</p>\n", "title": "Reinventing How America Votes Through Open Source Solutions", "start_time": "2010-07-22T10:40:00-07:00", "track_id": 22, "user_ids": [103, 192, 193], "room_id": 21, "end_time": "2010-07-22T11:20:00-07:00", "id": 206}
