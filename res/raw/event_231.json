{"description": "\n<p><strong>The Hadoop MapReduce <span class=\"caps\">API</span></strong><br /> \nLearn how to get started writing programs against Hadoop&#8217;s <span class=\"caps\">API</span>.</p>\n<p><strong>Introduction to MapReduce Algorithms</strong><br /> \nWriting programs for MapReduce requires analyzing problems in a new way. This lecture shows how some \ncommon functions can be expressed as part of a MapReduce pipeline.</p>\n<p><strong>Debugging MapReduce programs</strong><br /> \nDebugging in the distributed environment is challenging. This lecture will expose you to best practices for program \ndesign to mitigate debugging challenges, as well as local testing tools and techniques for debugging at scale.</p>\n<p><strong>Optimizing MapReduce Programs</strong><br /> \nWe&#8217;ll use the Cloudera Training VM to work through an example where you write a MapReduce program and \nimprove its performance using techniques explored earlier.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"caps\">NOTE</span></strong>: Attendees should download the Cloudera Training vm from <a href=\"http://cloudera.com/hadoop-training-virtual-machine\">http://cloudera.com/hadoop-training-virtual-machine</a>. VMWare Player (windows, linux) or VMWare Fusion (OS X) will be required in order to use it.</p>\n", "title": "Introduction to Hadoop (the how)", "start_time": "2010-07-19T13:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 9, "user_ids": [159], "room_id": 15, "end_time": "2010-07-19T17:00:00-07:00", "id": 231}
