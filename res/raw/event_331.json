{"description": "\n<p>Whereas at many points in medicine&#8217;s history a lack of good empirical data has been an impediment to improving treatment the ongoing national adoption of electronic medical records present the opposite problem. A pool of data so large and complex that providers and patients on their own can no longer process it in a timely or efficient fashion without help.</p>\n<p>We will take a brief look across number of open technologies and techniques for interpreting, aggregating and summarizing healthcare data. Noting that information about illness is often unique in nature in contrast to traditional data sets we will explore ways to efficiently visualize labs values, medications, codes and keywords; efficiently search, match and index textual and narrative information using neural nets, and also look at how techniques from other data intense industries such as supply chain can now be applied to healthcare.</p>\n", "title": "Data Mining in the EMR Gold Rush", "start_time": "2010-07-23T12:10:00-07:00", "track_id": 25, "user_ids": [279], "room_id": 16, "end_time": "2010-07-23T12:30:00-07:00", "id": 331}
