{"description": "\n<p>At long last, we now have a release of Perl 6 called &#8220;Rakudo Star&#8221;.  Rakudo Star is not intended to be a final Perl 6 product&#8212;it&#8217;s a waypoint to signal that Rakudo Perl 6 is reaching a level of implementation maturity where it&#8217;s suitable for some applications and other Early Adopter sorts of uses.</p>\n<p>Rakudo Star also intends to pioneer and evaluate some updated approaches to the process of language development and distribution itself.  For example, development of the Rakudo Perl compiler is being decoupled from the creation and management of &#8220;ready-to-use&#8221; packages of Perl 6, such as Rakudo Star.  This decoupling even extends to the notion that compilers and distributions can (and perhaps should) have separate release cycles and release managers. Other changes are also being pioneered through the\nRakudo Star release.</p>\n<p>Come to this talk to learn a bit of the history of Rakudo Star, the structure of the Rakudo Perl 6 project, and how we intend to use Rakudo Star as a foundation for building ever-more-mature distributions of Perl 6.</p>\n", "title": "Rakudo Star - A Usable Perl 6 Release", "start_time": "2010-07-23T11:00:00-07:00", "track_id": 8, "user_ids": [2061], "room_id": 8, "end_time": "2010-07-23T11:40:00-07:00", "id": 2127}
