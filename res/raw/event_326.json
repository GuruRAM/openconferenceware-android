{"description": "\n<p>Testing is a practice which is used across many languages and platforms. It was long considered something you should do rather than did. Many of the innovations in testing are happening in isolation. This talk will cover the state of the art in testing across the dynamic programming languages used in web development, client and server side.</p>\n<p>This talk will be about what&#8217;s happening in testing. The general argument is that we&#8217;re moving away from testing units towards testing functionality through integration testing. Improved mocking libraries, scripted and emulated browsers, fixtures, and frameworks means that we can effectively test that a system works.</p>\n<p>The talk will also look at the tricky issue, do communities who don&#8217;t test, avoid it because of their technology or culture.  The idea is not to focus on a single language or framework, but to learn what&#8217;s happening in many communities.</p>\n", "title": "Testing from Unit to Functional, Integration to Acceptance", "start_time": "2010-07-23T11:50:00-07:00", "track_id": 3, "user_ids": [315], "room_id": 20, "end_time": "2010-07-23T12:30:00-07:00", "id": 326}
