{"description": "\n<p>Everyone knows that the most successful open source projects are those that are built around thriving communities and an active and creative developer base. But how exactly is a participatory open source community built and nurtured?</p>\n<p>Likewise, the most successful open source projects also benefit from an active non-developer base of users that are influential in shaping how the community evolves and flourishes. But what does &#8220;active participation&#8221; actually mean and how involved should non-developer adopters and end-users be in the building and support of open source communities?</p>\n<p>In this session, Drupal project lead and Acquia co-founder and <span class=\"caps\">CTO</span> Dries Buytaert will share his secrets for building and participating in a thriving open source community and how collaboration amongst developer communities and non-developer adopters is critical to a healthy and sustainable project.  He&#8217;ll describe the mind set, mechanisms, and policies that are essential for community growth and share examples of both success and failure that he&#8217;s directly experienced while succeeding with the Drupal project. He will discuss how to turn a developer-only community into a healthy open source ecosystem which includes designers, developers, documentation writers and even corporate adopters and evangelists.</p>\n<p>Community managers will come away with clear action plans for kick-starting their development efforts and strategic adopters of open source will learn how to leverage open source project participation to multiply return on investment.</p>\n", "title": "The Secrets of Building and Participating in Open Source Communities", "start_time": "2010-07-22T11:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 10, "user_ids": [207], "room_id": 19, "end_time": "2010-07-22T12:10:00-07:00", "id": 218}
