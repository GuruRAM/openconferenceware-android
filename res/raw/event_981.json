{"description": "\n<p>Since the first eCommerce transaction was recorded back in 1981 dozens of payment alternatives have been introduced. Though the functionality and concepts for each solution remains nearly identical, the protocols and frameworks differ drastically from each other. Developers today are essentially forced to write custom code to integrate with each payment provider. This session explores how online payment platforms work, what kind of features and functionality they provide, various aspects of payment systems (security, privacy, payment networks, etc&#8230;), and the terminology used in the payments world. We will present our case for an Open Payments Platform to compliment the core foundations of the Open Social Web built on the technologies that are commonly referred to as \u201cOpen Stack\u201d.</p>\n", "title": "Open Stack for Open Payments", "start_time": "2010-07-21T16:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 13, "user_ids": [981, 987], "room_id": 5, "end_time": "2010-07-21T17:10:00-07:00", "id": 981}
