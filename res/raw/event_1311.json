{"description": "\n<p>Developers are now deploying Rails and Sinatra applications to Google App Engine. We have critical gems like redcloth and mechanize working, and your app runs in a servlet container, with access to all the Java APIs. Unlike a traditional Ruby hosting environment, new app instances spin up on demand, so you avoid paying for servers that sit idle. Unfortunately, each new JRuby runtime can take several seconds to spin-up, but there is a way to mitigate this without abandoning your agile web development techniques. Specific URLs can routed to Java servlets and bypass the JRuby runtime. This drastically improves performance, and can cut down spin-up to a second. Developers that prefer the expressiveness of Ruby, can now create servlets using Mirah instead of Java.</p>\n<p>Mirah (formerly Duby) is a new language with Ruby-inspired syntax that compiles to <span class=\"caps\">JVM</span> bytecode or to Java source. Mirah is statically typed with local type inference and a simple macro system. The goal is to make Mirah as expressive as Ruby without introducing any runtime library and while maintaining Java\u2019s level of performance. Mirah\u2019s toolchain is written in Ruby, making it easy to add new features and evolve the language\u2026and even customize the language for a specific project, library, or domain. Mirah has no runtime dependencies. In the future, Mirah may support additional backends like C#/CLR, Go, <span class=\"caps\">LLVM</span>, and more. Mirah is also a lot of fun!</p>\n", "title": "Ruby and Mirah on App Engine", "start_time": "2010-07-22T11:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 16, "user_ids": [1161, 1329], "room_id": 6, "end_time": "2010-07-22T12:10:00-07:00", "id": 1311}
