{"description": "\n<p>Ingex is a tapeless multi-camera studio recording system, built on open source software such as FFmpeg and Linux and released under the <span class=\"caps\">GPL</span> on <a href=\"http://ingex.sourceforge.net\">ingex.sourceforge.net</a>. Running on commodity hardware, with a broadcast quality video capture card, an Ingex box can replace tens of thousands of dollars worth of broadcast equipment in TV studios.</p>\n<p>The system was developed by <span class=\"caps\">BBC</span> R&#38;D and is now used in real productions within the <span class=\"caps\">BBC</span> (such as EastEnders and Dragon&#8217;s Den). Being available for free on the internet means that some enterprising third parties have implemented Ingex on their own</p>\n<p>We discuss the change management, commercial and ecosystem issues we have faced in getting Ingex used by the broadcasting industry, generally unaware of the benefits of open source.</p>\n<p>Topics include:</p>\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; creating partner programmes and certification schemes in the broadcast industry, creating the right incentives to build an ecosystem around a <span class=\"caps\">GPL</span> product<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; working with &#8220;dry hire&#8221; and &#8220;wet hire&#8221; agencies used to renting out hardware-only such as TV cameras and vision mixers<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; change management issues around TV production staff moving from hardware, tape-based environments to PC-based Linux software<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>We can also show videos demonstrating the Ingex tool in action on <span class=\"caps\">BBC TV</span> and radio programmes.</p>\n", "title": "Ingex: Bringing Open Source to the Broadcast Industry", "start_time": "2010-07-21T10:40:00-07:00", "track_id": 24, "user_ids": [651], "room_id": 14, "end_time": "2010-07-21T11:20:00-07:00", "id": 663}
