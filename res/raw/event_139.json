{"description": "\n<p>The speech would be segmented as follows:</p>\n<p>Introduction of the Sheeva <span class=\"caps\">CPU</span>\nMore I/O than imagined\nPractical Applications and Impractical Applications\nOS Compatibility\nActual Power Consumption\nBooting the Sheevaplug\nBenchmarking\nThe future of Plug Computing</p>\n<p>I will discuss the fine points and rough edges of the Sheevaplug and my experiences with the device over the past year. This device always\nbrings smile to people&#8217;s face, as it tends to reel the mind with its usage potential. I will also provide a power consumption chart to compare its power consumption with other servers and thin client devices.</p>\n<p>This device can be used for nearly anything you use your current computer for in the Linux/Unix infrastructure. I&#8217;ll outline many of the usage scenarios and share my experience therein.</p>\n<p>I will speak thoroughly but briefly about the I/O of this device, because it is really a <span class=\"caps\">STRONG</span> selling point of the unit. I&#8217;ll show other interesting projects and give credit to those who have deployed these units in commercial space and personal projects.</p>\n<p>During the presentation I&#8217;ll boot the device from several different medium to show the speed at which it boots and its versatility as a server/desktop/embedded platform.</p>\n<p>The device is wonderful but there are many caveats and things to avoid while exploring the Sheevaplug. I&#8217;m not selling this device so I will give the most accurate, spin free presentation as possible.</p>\n", "title": "Plug Computing Primer", "start_time": "2010-07-21T13:40:00-07:00", "track_id": 12, "user_ids": [124], "room_id": 9, "end_time": "2010-07-21T14:20:00-07:00", "id": 139}
