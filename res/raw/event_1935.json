{"description": "\n<p>Despite all the hype about cloud storage, many people still want their\nprimary data store to be on their local machine, and for good reason:\nyou get better bandwidth and latency, and your data is available even\nwhen the network is down (or if the <span class=\"caps\">FBI</span> raids the datacenter).  At the\nsame time, cloud storage makes for good backup, plus you can share data\nwith other people.</p>\n<p>Egnyte&#8217;s Local Cloud is a hybrid of local data and cloud storage that\ndoes automatic bidirectional synchronization.  We encountered and solved\na number of problems along the way, including:</p>\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Managing SQLite&#8217;s lack of concurrent access<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Compressing data transfers with librsync<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Ensuring failsafe downloads<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Dealing with open files on Windows<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Compressing upload data<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Handle conflicting local/remote updates<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>The presentation will include both discussion of problem/solution and\ncode samples.</p>\n", "title": "Hybrid Storage: Local Data, Remote Cloud", "start_time": "2010-07-23T11:00:00-07:00", "track_id": 13, "user_ids": [1959], "room_id": 14, "end_time": "2010-07-23T11:40:00-07:00", "id": 1935}
