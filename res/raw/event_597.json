{"description": "\n<p>The Perl 5 we can write in 2010 looks like a difference, nicer, language than the Perl 5 we wrote even 5 years ago. New modules aren&#8217;t just changing Perl programmers&#8217; expectations about what they can expect from Perl objects, they are improving seemingly fundamental things like the way we deal with method parameters.</p>\n<p>This talk covers the main syntax changers that make Perl a pleasure to write again: MooseX::Declare, TryCatch, Moose::Autobox and shows how they work together with other modern Perl modules to rejuvenate the language.</p>\n<p>Yukihiro Matsumoto, the creator of Ruby, is credited with saying that Ruby is Perl done right. Four years ago, when I left Perl programming to work with Ruby, I would have agreed with him. Today, because of the tools that I cover in this talk, I&#8217;m inclined to say that, on the contrary, Perl 5 is Perl done right.</p>\n", "title": "New Beginnings in Perl 5", "start_time": "2010-07-21T10:40:00-07:00", "track_id": 8, "user_ids": [573], "room_id": 8, "end_time": "2010-07-21T11:20:00-07:00", "id": 597}
