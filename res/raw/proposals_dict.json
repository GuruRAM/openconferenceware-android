It uses two open source technologies Squid and Traffic Server (recently open sourced by Yahoo! under apache license).\r\n\r\nThe main principle behind it is to delegate the request to an offline proxy system such as SQUID to perform the actual request. This allows the initial request to use a very small timeout but yet the proxy system will continue to wait for the request to complete and then cache the response once it comes back. A subsequent request or 'retry request' is made to check the data in the proxy system cache instead of the actual source. The timed out request sends the squid key back to the client to track the availability of the resource quickly without going through the normal web server route. \r\n\r\nThe traffic server which can handle thousands of concurrent connections has a plugin which can quickly check the status of the key from squid directly and if the data is indeed available, can forward the request to corresponding web servers.\r\n\r\nWith this approach, server resource does not need to be tied up for the entire duration for the response to come back. Instead, just use limited resource to fire the request and then tell the client(browser) to wait a period of time before firing another request(retry request) to check for response. As a result, transferring a significant amount of wait time from server resources to the client side and freeing up that server resource to process other requests. Each retry request will be optimized to firstly just check whether the data is available in cache using the traffic server plugin before executing the webpage or module which requires that data. This saves the need to process a webpage or a module only to find that the data is not yet available in cache and process the page only once the data is indeed available thus saving cpu cycles. Since the request reaches web server only when data is available and hence it is an efficient utilization of server processes.\r\n\r\nAlso an additional challenge the system need to address is determining what timeouts to use for each retry. This could be tracked by a very simple state at server and slowly adjusted and learned with requests to determine the optimal time interval to be given for retries and reducing failed attempts.\r\n\r\nThus for very high traffic systems like yahoo homepage , where we have data coming from different external sources with varying timeouts we can defer the request for multiple retry and load the page as soon as possible. Each retry request would be extremely fast to just check for the data availability in cache thus freeing server time and other processing resources. This solution does not require keep-alive connections to be maintained and hence has very little server setup overhead."}, "367": {"website": null, "user_id": null, "submitted_at": "2010-03-24T15:41:06-07:00", "title": "Speeding up your PHP Application", "event_id": 2011, "created_at": "2010-03-24T15:41:06-07:00", "updated_at": "2010-05-15T14:35:04-07:00", "presenter": null, "affiliation": null, "id": 367, "biography": null, "description": "There has been a lot of interest in PHP performance lately, spurred by\r\nFacebook's HipHop PHP announcement in February.

PHP is a scripting language with dynamic, weak typing. C++ is a compiled language with static typing. While PHP allows you to write magical dynamic features, most PHP is relatively straightforward. It's more likely that you see if (...) {...} else {..} than it is to see function foo($x) { include $x; }. This is where we gain in performance. Whenever possible our generated code uses static binding for functions and variables. We also use type inference to pick the most specific type possible for our variables and thus save memory.\r\n\r\nThe transformation process includes three main steps:\r\n\r\n1. Static analysis where we collect information on who declares what and dependencies,\r\n2. Type inference where we choose the most specific type between C++ scalars, String, Array, classes, Object, and Variant, and\r\n3. Code generation, which for the most part is a direct correspondence from PHP statements and expressions to C++ statements and expressions.\r\n\r\nWe have also developed HPHPi, which is an experimental interpreter designed for development. When using HPHPi you don't need to compile your PHP source code before running it. It's helped us catch bugs in HipHop itself and provides engineers a way to use HipHop without changing how they write PHP.\r\n\r\nOverall HipHop allows us to keep the best aspects of PHP while taking advantage of the performance benefits of C++. In total, we have written over 300,000 lines of code and more than 5,000 unit tests. All of this will be released this evening on GitHub under the open source PHP license.\r\n"}, "311": {"website": null, "user_id": null, "submitted_at": "2010-03-03T16:37:54-08:00", "title": "XHP for PHP", "event_id": 2011, "created_at": "2010-03-03T16:37:54-08:00", "updated_at": "2010-05-15T14:36:52-07:00", "presenter": null, "affiliation": null, "id": 311, "biography": null, "description": "XHP is a PHP extension which augments the syntax of the language such that XML document fragments become valid PHP expressions.

Called Tiki Profiles, these configurations are extremely modular, and can be combined to form larger applications. For example, it is possible to combine the configurations for a Time Sheet, a Task List and a Consultant List, to create a basic consultant time-management system. When executed, the Tiki Profiles engine will automatically configure necessary features, create content pages, data structures, user groups, permissions, and input forms that make up the application.\r\n\r\nThese modular configurations in easy-to-learn YAML are shared just like open source code, but within a wiki, profiles.tikiwiki.org. Not just developers, but power users and business analysts can enhance or combine these configurations, leading to new and innovative applications for the platform. For example, the basic consultant time-management system as mentioned above can easily be augmented with a Budget Tracking application to enhance billing management. Repeated application configuration becomes easy, and application variants can be managed more effectively as incremental add-ons to the same base Tiki Profile.\r\n\r\nThe same approach of open-source sharing of configurations should be applicable to most platforms that involve significant numbers of configuration options and choices leading to differing applications. It can also allow power-users and not just coders to be more involved in contributing to the open source community."}, "399": {"website": null, "user_id": null, "submitted_at": "2010-03-25T13:37:49-07:00", "title": "Using Modern Perl", "event_id": 2011, "created_at": "2010-03-25T13:37:49-07:00", "updated_at": "2010-05-15T14:30:57-07:00", "presenter": null, "affiliation": null, "id": 399, "biography": null, "description": "It's easy to find examples of poorly-written Perl code: global variables, punctuation soup, copy and paste code, commented-out functions.

During the session, we will cover the following topics:\r\n\r\n* What Pressflow is and how it is different from the Drupal content management system\r\n* What Varnish is and what it can do to help\r\n* Why Pressflow+Varnish may be a good option for your web site\r\n* Tips and tools for tuning and optimizing your configuration to make the most out of your precious server resources\r\n* Lessons learned \u2013 what not to do\r\n* Real-world examples from live sites running Pressflow and Varnish\r\n\r\nThe open source Drupal content management system powers numerous prominent web sites including:\r\n* President Obama\u2019s White House web site\r\n* Linux Journal\r\n* Zappos\r\n\r\nPressflow and Varnish are being used by some of the largest Drupal sites in the world:\r\n* The Economist Online\r\n* NBC Universal Bravo TV\r\n* The Grammy Awards"}, "449": {"website": null, "user_id": null, "submitted_at": "2010-03-25T22:50:58-07:00", "title": "How to build a simple website in Drupal in an hour -ish", "event_id": 2011, "created_at": "2010-03-25T22:50:58-07:00", "updated_at": "2010-03-25T22:50:58-07:00", "presenter": null, "affiliation": null, "id": 449, "biography": null, "description": "You can do anything with Drupal... which can make it more than a little intimidating.

However, Xlib has not been well-matched to the needs of X clients for some time now. We felt it had earned retirement, so we created a new X-protocol C Binding (XCB) library, providing a simple, small, thread-transparent interface to X. But to support all the applications that haven't magically ported themselves to XCB yet, we needed a transition plan.\r\n\r\nWe first tried re-writing Xlib from scratch as a layer on top of XCB. That was hard. So we stopped.\r\n\r\nThen we added some hooks to XCB to allow Xlib to remain mostly unchanged but send requests through XCB. That worked, mostly; however, the complexity of this approach led to bugs, ugly hacks in XCB, and far more hacking on Xlib than continued sanity permitted. Adding special code in our clean new XCB library just to keep the old Xlib way working made us sad, and the looming prospect of becoming the Xlib maintainers made us lose sleep. So we stopped that too.\r\n\r\nThe current versions of Xlib and XCB now use a technique that we call \"socket handoff\", cooperatively alternating exclusive access to the X connection instead of dumping Xlib's requests through XCB. Socket handoff allowed us to delete a pile of buggy, hackish code, while improving performance, and that made us happy. So we didn't stop.\r\n\r\nThe socket handoff interface has proven to be useful not just for Xlib, but also for new language bindings to XCB and for experimental X protocol-level hacks. We believe other network protocol implementations would also benefit from this approach.\r\n\r\nBy the way, you may be running our socket handoff code on your system right now, so why not come hear about the code used by every application on your desktop?"}, "382": {"website": null, "user_id": null, "submitted_at": "2010-03-25T02:26:23-07:00", "title": "Reprogramming Asian Business with Open Source", "event_id": 2011, "created_at": "2010-03-25T02:26:23-07:00", "updated_at": "2010-03-25T02:26:23-07:00", "presenter": null, "affiliation": null, "id": 382, "biography": null, "description": "Asian manufacturing groups in Taiwan, China, Vietnam and Korea are the engine behind American brands.

Seeing IT as the agent and catalyst to rebuild the way that the company can operate as a whole. Open Source technologies and attitudes have an opportunity to reshape several key aspects. Open Source thinking brings a do-it-yourself attitude to areas of IT where large proprietary systems have traditionally been used, the follow aspects are discussed in this talk:\r\n\r\nThe cost of business IT systems: Increasing labor costs are forcing Asian companies invest in infrastructure and systems, rather than throwing manpower at problems. However, systems from Oracle, Microsoft and SAP are simply too expensive to purchase and maintain. Linux on the desktop: Asian companies are having a much easier time than Western to jump straight from decrepit Windows desktops to simple, low-cost Linux-based desktops. Particularly as more work moves from traditional office applications to web-based systems. Users are far less cynical and picky than in the west. Utility is the key. Collaboration systems: With safer Linux-based desktops, Asian companies are feeling more free to explore Internet-based collaboration tools as well as a wide array of self hosted tools: Wiki systems for content & knowledge management and collaboration, IM and VoIP. Larger scale cultural and management issues (such as \u201cface\u201d, direct conflict avoidance, and strict hierarchical organizations) are challenged and shifted by this new technological approach.

We'll demonstrate how we've been merging available technologies with custom programming to create location-aware social networks with custom proximity notification. Finally, we'll describe other uses for location sharing, such as automatically turning off house lights when leaving for work, and wayfinding with piezoelectric buzzers. Privacy and data transparency will also be discussed.\r\n\r\nAaron will also present data visualizations, animations, and a glimpse of the raw data of his two years of to-the-second GPS logs which provide the basis of the location-based augmented reality system.

We will also look at the engineering considerations when writing  parallel programs, and the tools Haskell provides for debugging and reasoning about parallel programs.\r\n\r\nThis is a hands on tutorial session: bring your laptops, there will be code!"}, "327": {"website": null, "user_id": null, "submitted_at": "2010-03-14T19:08:02-07:00", "title": "SugarCRM - Your next open source business application framework", "event_id": 2011, "created_at": "2010-03-14T19:08:02-07:00", "updated_at": "2010-03-14T19:08:02-07:00", "presenter": null, "affiliation": null, "id": 327, "biography": null, "description": "SugarCRM is the world\u2019s leading provider of commercial open source CRM software, available in both an On-Demand and On-Premise version and comes with an open source license.

Besides it's powerful integration of the object-oriented and functional programming paradigms, it has strong capabilities for integrating with existing Java code. One very effective mechanism for bringing Scala into your environment is to use it for exploring the capabilities of Java libraries. Every experienced Java developer understands the pain of setting up the scaffolding needed to try out a new library (not to mention the well known \"dependency hell\" that comes along for the ride). With Scala and the tools available with it, you can reduce this pain by orders of magnitude. This talk will briefly introduce Scala and Simple Build Tool and then move on to show you how to quickly get started integrating Java libraries and exploring them in code. Through these examples, you will also learn how make use of Scala alongside your existing code."}, "475": {"website": null, "user_id": null, "submitted_at": "2010-03-29T21:24:31-07:00", "title": "The Complex Ethics of Piracy", "event_id": 2011, "created_at": "2010-03-29T21:24:31-07:00", "updated_at": "2010-05-03T17:40:22-07:00", "presenter": null, "affiliation": null, "id": 475, "biography": null, "description": "Despite a decade of the war on file sharing, copyright piracy continues to be a widespread social phenomenon.\r\n\r\nDebates about the ethical status of piracy are often bipolar: copyright holders attempt to equate piracy with \"theft\", while hacker and pirate groups argue that copyright is unsustainable and view piracy as good, inevitable, or promoting of renewal in cultural industries. Informally, some file sharers defend a position along the lines of \"I pirate music, but then I buy CDs from the bands I like\" or \"I pirate major label music but buy independent artists' CDs\".\r\n\r\nThis talk examines the coherence of these positions. Is piracy ever \"theft\" in an ethical sense? If it's not theft, is it selfish? Is pirating major label music an ethically defensible form of civil disobedience? If it was ethical to engage in piracy as a form of protest, would that create an obligation to engage in piracy?\r\n\r\nThe conclusions are complex. The ethical status of piracy turns out to depend on difficult social choices about justice and aesthetic priorities, on what is being copied, and on who is copying it. On some theories, even if there are limited circumstances in which piracy is justified as a form of civil disobedience, many file sharers go too far with their actions. On the other hand, there may be circumstances in which there are weak ethical obligations to pirate things, and non-pirates could be said to be ignoring those obligations."}, "478": {"website": null, "user_id": null, "submitted_at": "2010-03-29T23:01:00-07:00", "title": "Free Speech, Free Software Across the World ", "event_id": 2011, "created_at": "2010-03-29T23:01:00-07:00", "updated_at": "2010-05-15T14:18:03-07:00", "presenter": null, "affiliation": null, "id": 478, "biography": null, "description": "The Committee to Protect Journalists monitors and coordinates assistance globally for those persecuted for their reporting, newsgathering, or analysis.
