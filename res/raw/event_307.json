{"description": "\n<p>Your applications need to scale and they need to integrate with the outside world. Web 2.0 is all about giving your customers something they can invest in &#8211; something that they want to see grow. You do that by integrating with what they care about, and these days, they care about their communities. This talk explores the fundamentals of an <span class=\"caps\">ESB</span> (enterprise service bus) and speaks to how one (the Spring Integration framework) might be used to bring your application to where your customers are. The attendee will learn about building event driven applications integrations in a generic, re-usable way. The implications of this approach is that you can use these services, and their built-in audiences, to build your business. Web 2.0 is all about this integration between data and services: people have Twitter bots that react to tweets with a specific hash or analyze them. Applications can harvest user information from Facebook, and Ping.FM can be used to provide you with a quick way to surface your application&#8217;s functionality in many different services.</p>\n", "title": "The Social Enterprise Service Bus", "start_time": "2010-07-23T11:00:00-07:00", "track_id": 11, "user_ids": [299], "room_id": 5, "end_time": "2010-07-23T11:40:00-07:00", "id": 307}
