It is a practical, imperative, object oriented language that includes many  features: closures, support for composition, and extensions to existing classes, to name a few.  It also has an <span class=\"caps\">API</span> for introducing new kinds of types called the Open Type System, which allows new resources to be plugged into the compiler without modifying the underlying language or compiler.</p>\n<p>This talk will give a quick overview of the language and the Open Type System as a sneak peek before it is officially introduced by Scott McKinney at the <span class=\"caps\">JVM</span> Language Summit the following week.</p>\n", "title": "A Sneak Peek at Gosu", "start_time": "2010-07-22T16:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 2, "user_ids": [262], "room_id": 23, "end_time": "2010-07-22T16:50:00-07:00", "id": 271}
