{"description": "\n<p>Eli Lilly and Company will present how we have used open source software and cloud computing to build both a High Performance Computing (HPC) environment and a Self Service virtual machine provisioning portal to support pharmaceutical research and development scientists.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"caps\">HPC</span></strong></p>\n<p>Lilly has worked with Cycle Computing to install the Condor grid computing environment in both an internal cluster and on-demand clusters in Amazon&#8217;s Elastic Compute Cloud. This allows researchers to efficiently use existing resources as well as spill over to &#8220;cloudburst&#8221; when internal capacity has been exceeded. We&#8217;ll demo a real life Lilly R&#38;D workflow using internal resources and dynamically cloudbursting into <span class=\"caps\">EC2</span></p>\n<p><strong>Self Service</strong></p>\n<p>Working with Rightscale, Lilly has also created a way for computational scientists to start virtual servers (in both the Elastic Compute Cloud and Virtual Private Cloud) running any one of several canned application stacks in minutes rather than waiting the usual 5-6 weeks to provision a virtual machine on internal hardware. These app stacks are constructed using Chef cookbooks and support computational chemistry, internal software development and external collaboration. We&#8217;ll demo starting an app stack including metering and monitoring of the instances and how we can show control of the environments once they are launched.</p>\n", "title": "Pharmaceutical Research in the Cloud", "start_time": "2010-07-21T17:20:00-07:00", "track_id": 13, "user_ids": [169], "room_id": 5, "end_time": "2010-07-21T18:00:00-07:00", "id": 179}
