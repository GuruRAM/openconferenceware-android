{"description": "\n<p>In 1998, Eric Raymond and Bruce Perens repurposed Debian&#8217;s Free Software Guidelines into the Open Source Initiative&#8217;s Open Source Definition, with the idea of creating an industry-wide standard for the then-new term &#8220;Open Source&#8221;.  There&#8217;s now enough data trying to be free that we should create a similar standard for &#8220;Open Data&#8221;.  Some people think that the standard is obvious: public domain.  Others believe that a license like CC-By or CC-By-SA are necessary.  Others propose that new licenses are necessary, such as the Open Database License.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s create a draft Open Data Definition, to be published alongside the Open Source Definition.  If we can&#8217;t finish the draft in an hour, we can at least lay out the salient points in a high bandwidth face to face meeting.</p>\n", "title": "Writing an Open Source Definition for Open Data", "start_time": "2010-07-21T19:00:00-07:00", "track_id": 14, "user_ids": [1137], "room_id": 20, "end_time": "2010-07-21T20:00:00-07:00", "id": 1191}
