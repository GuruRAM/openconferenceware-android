{"description": "\n<p>HealthCare IT is characterized by various silos encompassing payment systems, labs management systems, medication management systems, imaging systems and various other hospital management systems. In addition to maintaining these systems a HealthCare IT professional deals with multitude of standards for data protocols and terminologies.</p>\n<p>It has been established that HealthCare can be streamlined and associated costs can be reduced drastically if a patient is able to have greater control in the current ecosystem. Several personally controlled health record systems have been proposed and implemented, including solutions from Google, Microsoft, and Dossia. Standards like <span class=\"caps\">CCR</span> &#38; <span class=\"caps\">CCD</span> have been gaining ground and recommendations &#38; guidelines for preferable medical terminologies like <span class=\"caps\">SNOMED</span>-CT or <span class=\"caps\">ICD</span>-10 has been order of business at office of national coordination (ONC) of Health.</p>\n<p>This talk will go in take a deep dive with practical examples of how to interface various Hospital systems through <span class=\"caps\">CCR</span> &#38; <span class=\"caps\">CCD</span> to various Personally controlled health record systems. We will take specific examples from use cases encompassing explanation of benefits, labs, medications, imaging, <span class=\"caps\">H1N1</span> reporting and master patient indexes. The talk will weave all the above use cases in one simple open-source python application.</p>\n<p>While discussing the working code and solution architecture we will touch on various aspects of privacy and security needed to be addressed while dealing with HealthCare data.</p>\n", "title": "Programming HealthCare Silos", "start_time": "2010-07-23T11:00:00-07:00", "track_id": 25, "user_ids": [1953], "room_id": 16, "end_time": "2010-07-23T11:20:00-07:00", "id": 1929}
