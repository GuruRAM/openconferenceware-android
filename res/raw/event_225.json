{"description": "\n<p>This is a multi-faceted tutorial that explores new concepts in web security. After a solid grounding in well-known exploits like cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgeries (CSRF), I&#8217;ll demonstrate how traditional exploits are being combined together and with other technologies like Ajax to launch sophisticated attacks that penetrate firewalls, target users, and spread like worms. I&#8217;ll then discuss some ideas for the future, such as evaluating trends to identify suspicious activity and understanding human tendencies and behavior to help provide a better, more secure user experience.</p>\n", "title": "Evolution of Web Security: Fundamentals, Emerging Trends, and Ideas for the Future", "start_time": "2010-07-19T13:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 3, "user_ids": [231], "room_id": 14, "end_time": "2010-07-19T17:00:00-07:00", "id": 225}
