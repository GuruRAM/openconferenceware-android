Always wanting to experience California, he moved to Silicon Valley in 1991 just in time to ride the .com wave. In 1997 Brian joined the startup NetDynamics, which was pushing a new concept called an application server. In 1998 NetDynamics was acquired by Sun and soon after <span class=\"caps\">J2EE</span> (now Java EE) was born. After spending a large part of his career working in the Java application server space, Brian joined the NetBeans team to focus on building its developer community. In 2008, Brian joined the OpenSolaris team to help do the same for its community. Brian currently splits his time between delivering presentations and writing about OpenSolaris on his blog The Observatory."}
