{"description": "\n<p>Cloud computing promises to forever change the economics of information technology. Yet, because ownership of hardware resources may end up in the hands of fewer and fewer entities, it also changes the economics of open source software.</p>\n<p>James Urquhart, author of &#8220;The Wisdom of Clouds&#8221;, a blog on the <span class=\"caps\">CNET</span> blog network, and one of the 10 most influential people in cloud computing according to <span class=\"caps\">MIT</span> Technology Review, will  explore the ways in which cloud computing may evolve, both technically and from a market perspective.</p>\n<p>Understanding how the various possible outcomes effect open source delivery and business models will allow open source projects to choose their optimal packaging, marketing and business models. Urquhart will help attendees understand why some models are better than others for open source software.</p>\n\n\nExample topics include:\n\t\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Cloud as a natural destination for open source businesses<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; infrastructure, platform and software services&#8212;which model is best for your project/business?<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Why some vendors will support open source better than others<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; How to leverage cloud communities to bolster your open source project&#8212;and vice versa<br/>\n<br/>\n", "title": "Anatomy of an Open Source Cloud Ecosystem", "start_time": "2010-07-21T10:40:00-07:00", "track_id": 13, "user_ids": [531], "room_id": 5, "end_time": "2010-07-21T11:20:00-07:00", "id": 579}
