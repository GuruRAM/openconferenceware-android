{"description": "\n<p>It\u2019s much simpler to write Rails applications when you don\u2019t have any legacy data, applications or technologies to deal with, but many of us are not that lucky.  Large Enterprises impose many constraints on us as developers, in this talk we\u2019ll discuss our experiences working in a large enterprise that has a long history building big applications with few-to-no tests.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of information locked away in large enterprise databases but its hard to work with.  We&#8217;ll demonstrate a tool we developed to extract much of that information into your new Rails application.  We&#8217;ll also demonstrate how to write tests for these old applications using the latest Ruby testing frameworks.</p>\n<p>You will see example of:</p>\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Bootstraping an application from an existing database <br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Issues you may encounter when working with an over-complicated existing legacy database <br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Using Ruby testing frameworks to test an existing <span class=\"caps\">J2EE</span> application<br/>\n<br/>\n", "title": "Off the Beaten Path: Using Rails in the Enterprise", "start_time": "2010-07-22T16:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 16, "user_ids": [252, 253], "room_id": 6, "end_time": "2010-07-22T17:10:00-07:00", "id": 262}
