{"description": "\n<p>We will present Eucalyptus&#8212;Elastic Utility Computing Architecture for Linking Your Programs to Useful Systems&#8212;an open source software infrastructure that implements IaaS-style cloud computing. The goal of Eucalyptus is to allow sites with existing clusters and server infrastructure to host an elastic computing service that is interface-compatible with Amazon&#8217;s <span class=\"caps\">AWS</span>, but can also support multiple interfaces such as Google&#8217;s AppEngine and the Sun Cloud open <span class=\"caps\">API</span>.</p>\n<p>The talk will focus on specific features of the system that are designed to enable rapid development, prototyping, and deployment of local computing clouds, particularly for debugging and/or application development purposes.  It will also discuss experiences with hosting the Eucalyptus Public Cloud (EPC) as a free public cloud platform for experimental use and the ability to use the <span class=\"caps\">EPC</span> in conjunction with commercial web development services that target <span class=\"caps\">AWS</span>, such as RightScale.  Finally, we will discuss our experiences in building and supporting open source cloud infrastructure and point to potential future directions that we believe will enable greater innovation.</p>\n", "title": "Eucalyptus: The Open Source Infrastructure for Cloud Computing", "start_time": "2010-07-22T13:40:00-07:00", "track_id": 13, "user_ids": [1509, 2139], "room_id": 14, "end_time": "2010-07-22T14:20:00-07:00", "id": 1485}
