{"description": "\n<p>In the past three years, the Rubinius project has evolved from a hobby attempt to implement Ruby using as much Ruby as possible to a full-featured system boasting an extremely fast VM, advanced garbage collector, and <span class=\"caps\">LLVM</span>-based profile-driven <span class=\"caps\">JIT</span> with run-time type feedback.</p>\n<p>As with the Java Hotspot VM, these features make Rubinius an attractive platform for experimenting with implementing other languages.</p>\n<p>The Lua programming language is known to have very fast implementation and Lua has been used from the beginning for data processing tasks. <span class=\"caps\">LPEG</span> is an implementation of a Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG) using a stack machine. The performance of <span class=\"caps\">LPEG</span> is on par with a parser generated by Lex/Yacc for some tasks.</p>\n<p>Pegarus is an implementation of the <span class=\"caps\">LPEG</span> ideas on the Rubinius platform. Pegarus is used as the parser to implement Poison, a version of _why&#8217;s Potion programming language.</p>\n<p>This talk will describe Rubinius as a platform for implementation of languages other than Ruby. Details of implementing Pegarus and Poison will be provided. Both these projects are experimental.</p>\n", "title": "Pegarus and Poison: Rubinius VM as a Multi-Language Platform", "start_time": "2010-07-22T17:20:00-07:00", "track_id": 16, "user_ids": [1725], "room_id": 6, "end_time": "2010-07-22T18:00:00-07:00", "id": 1689}
