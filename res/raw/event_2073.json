{"description": "\n<p>Join Sam Johnston, Simon Wardley, James Urquhart and John Mark Walker at the Open Cloud BoF. The Open Cloud Initiative was founded to define Open Cloud Principles and build industry momentum around the concepts. You can find Sam Johnston&#8217;s draft of the Open Cloud Principles here &#8211; http://opencloud.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/oci/ocp/open-cloud-principles.html</p>\n<p>The next steps are getting input and building consensus around basic principles. At this BoF, industry veterans, hackers, privacy advocates, and cloud enthusiasts will come together to discuss the vision for open cloud and the technology that makes it feasible. As cloud computing adoption continues to accelerate, it becomes paramount to discuss the relationship between cloud computing and open source software, the open data movement, open APIs, data and service portability, and online privacy and data ownership.</p>\n<p>Part of the discussion will revolve around these topics:</p>\n<p>- Open Source in the cloud: open source cloud platforms, open source apps in the cloud, and open source licensing trends</p>\n<p>- Open Data: data ownership, the (in)compatibility of privacy and open data, and when open data isn&#8217;t really open</p>\n<p>- Open APIs: The mandate for service portability and interoperability, is an Open <span class=\"caps\">API</span> enough? and the threat of trademark and patent law</p>\n<p>We will take the opportunity to highlight progress so far and what remains. Please join our efforts.</p>\n", "title": "Open Cloud BoF", "start_time": "2010-07-21T19:00:00-07:00", "track_id": 14, "user_ids": [2097], "room_id": 13, "end_time": "2010-07-21T20:00:00-07:00", "id": 2073}
