{"description": "\n<p>The cloud is all about more connectivity \u2013 and interoperability is at the heart of that. Organizations around the world are looking at opportunities to leverage a new wave of cloud technologies. New data sets. New computing power. We believe that making it easy to move data in and out of the cloud, and having developers chose their favorite programming language are essential attributes of an open cloud.
