{"description": "\n<p>This 3 hour course will be presented in several stages of presentation and activity. Each stage\u00e2&euro;&trade;s presentation will detail one or more new topics by using slides, demonstrations, and screencasts. Following each of these presentations, you will then take the ropes and get your hands dirty, solving code challenges and tasks that will reinforce those concepts. During the course the Envy Labs team will be right behind you to answer any questions that you may have.</p>\n<p>This is a very hands-on course and we expect that you will not only walk away with a working Rails 3 application, but also a more thorough understanding of the new framework and how Rails 3 will become an integral part of your future web applications.</p>\n", "title": "The Rails 3 Ropes Course", "start_time": "2010-07-20T08:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 16, "user_ids": [41, 42, 43, 44], "room_id": 5, "end_time": "2010-07-20T12:00:00-07:00", "id": 57}
