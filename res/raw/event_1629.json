{"description": "\n<p>Much of the power of <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span>, the <span class=\"caps\">GNU</span> Image Manipulation program, comes from its plug-in architecture. Most of the functions you use in <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span>, including everything in the Filters menu, are plug-ins.</p>\n<p>In this talk, you\u2019ll learn to write your own <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> plug-ins in two languages: Python and Script-fu.</p>\n<p>Python is rapidly becoming the language of choice for <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> plug-ins because of its flexibility and clean <span class=\"caps\">API</span>. You\u2019ll see how Python\u2019s access to raw pixel data in an image gives it a huge advantage over Script-fu, and how you can use Python-GTK to create user interfaces far beyond <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span>\u2019s usual plug-in dialogs.</p>\n<p>Script-Fu is <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span>\u2019s native language, installed in every version of <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span>. Script-fu is a variant of Scheme, but you don\u2019t need to be fluent in Scheme or Lisp to write Script-fu. You just need to know a few basics of Lisp syntax and how to find the right <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> call to do what you need. I\u2019ll also cover some of the script-fu changes introduced in 2.4, how to update older scripts, and how to make sure your new scripts will run on all <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> versions.</p>\n", "title": "Writing GIMP Plug-ins and Scripts", "start_time": "2010-07-22T16:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 5, "user_ids": [1653], "room_id": 10, "end_time": "2010-07-22T17:10:00-07:00", "id": 1629}
