{"description": "\n<p>Redwood MedNet is a Health Information Exchange formed in 2004 in rural Mendocino County in Northern California.  Over the past six years Redwood MedNet has secured $1.2 million in grant funds, and has built the <span class=\"caps\">HIE</span> service entirely with open source software.  Redwood MedNet began the production delivery of health data in April 2008, and currently serves dozens of health care providers in the Mendocino, Lake, Sonoma and Marin county region north of San Francisco.  The first half of the presentation will explain the general <span class=\"caps\">HIE</span> use case, and why open source software is a good fit.  The second half of the presentation will explain the primary features of the Mirth open source software, which is used by Redwood MedNet.</p>\n", "title": "Building the Redwood MedNet HIE with Mirth Open Source Tools", "start_time": "2010-07-22T16:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 25, "user_ids": [1689, 1695, 2157], "room_id": 16, "end_time": "2010-07-22T16:50:00-07:00", "id": 1659}
