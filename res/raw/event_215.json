{"description": "\n<p>Developers are now deploying Rails and Sinatra applications to Google App Engine. We have critical gems like redcloth and mechanize working, and your app runs in a servlet container, with access to all the Java APIs. Unlike a traditional Ruby hosting environment, new app instances spin up on demand, so you avoid paying for servers that sit idle. Unfortunately, each new JRuby runtime can take several seconds to spin-up, but there is a way to mitigate this without abandoning your agile web development techniques. Specific URLs can routed to Java servlets and bypass the JRuby runtime. This drastically improves performance, and can cut down spin-up to a second. Rubyists that would prefer to stay away from Java, can instead look at using Duby.</p>\n<p>Duby is a new language with Ruby-inspired syntax that compiles to <span class=\"caps\">JVM</span>\nbytecode or to Java source. Duby is statically typed with local type\ninference and a simple macro system. The goal is to make Duby as\nexpressive as Ruby without introducing any runtime library and while\nmaintaining Java&#8217;s level of performance. Duby&#8217;s toolchain is written\nin Ruby, making it easy to add new features and evolve the\nlanguage&#8230;and even customize the language for a specific project,\nlibrary, or domain. Duby has no runtime dependencies. In the future,\nDuby may support additional backends like C#/CLR, Go, <span class=\"caps\">LLVM</span>, and more.\nDuby is also a lot of fun!</p>\n", "title": "Ruby and Duby on App Engine", "start_time": "2010-07-22T11:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 16, "user_ids": [180, 206], "room_id": 6, "end_time": "2010-07-22T12:10:00-07:00", "id": 215}
