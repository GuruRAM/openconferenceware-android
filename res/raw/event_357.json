{"description": "\n<p><strong>An introduction to Hive and Hadoop</strong><br /> \nThe basics.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting data into Hive</strong><br /> \nLearn how to create tables in Hive, using the appropriate table properties and data types. Then we will cover \nloading data into Hive from files on a local file system, files in <span class=\"caps\">HDFS</span> or data in an <span class=\"caps\">RDBMS</span>.</p>\n<p><strong>HiveQL</strong><br />  \nThe Hive Query Language is an <span class=\"caps\">SQL</span>-like language for querying data in Hadoop. It supports a subset of <span class=\"caps\">SQL</span>-92 \nfeatures, but also adds Hive/Hadoop-specific enhancements.</p>\n<p><strong>Query Execution</strong><br />  \nThis section will explain how Hive converts queries into MapReduce code that is executed on the Hadoop cluster.</p>\n<p><strong>Partitioning and Bucketing</strong><br />  \nA powerful feature of Hive is the ability to partition and bucket your data. Partitioning is a way of organizing large \ndata sets into distinct subsets.  Bucketing is useful for sampling a fraction of data.</p>\n<p><strong>Best Practices</strong><br />  \nThese are specific recommendations for configuring Hive, handling data properly, and designing for performance.</p>\n", "title": "Introduction to Hive - CANCELED", "start_time": "2010-07-20T08:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 9, "user_ids": [159], "room_id": 15, "end_time": "2010-07-20T12:00:00-07:00", "id": 357}
