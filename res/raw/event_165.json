This lecture &#8220;lifts \nthe curtain&#8221; and explains how the technology works. You&#8217;ll understand how these components fit together and \nbuild on one another to provide a scalable and powerful system.</p>\n<p><strong>The Hadoop Ecosystem</strong><br /> \nAn introduction to other projects surrounding Hadoop, which complete the greater ecosystem of available large- \ndata processing tools.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmenting Existing Systems with Hadoop</strong><br /> \nHadoop rarely replaces existing infrastructure, but rather enables you to do more with your data by providing a \nscalable batch processing system.
