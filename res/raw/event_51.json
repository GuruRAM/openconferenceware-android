{"description": "\n<p>In a world where the internet is driving all things digital to free, why does it make sense to pay someone to increase the discovery of your application? In the virtual landscape, what are the scarcities that are created by the over-abundance of free? More importantly, what is the value of the scarcity?</p>\n<p>I will present ideas on how paying for the ability to reach a diverse set of customers with a high level of quality can pay off more quickly than \u201cthinking like a dandelion\u201d (Cory Doctorow). I have current examples to show how piggy-backing off other\u2019s brand awareness can impact your reach and quality, as well as the tools required to measure your success without infringing on the privacy rights of your users. I will provide some thoughts on making \u201cfree\u201d a successful part of your business model, (Chris Anderson) whether you are looking to increase your distribution or monetize an existing product.</p>\n<p>All this is to start a lively discussion. If we all share a little, we will all learn more than we share.</p>\n", "title": "Ideas When Distributing Applications", "start_time": "2010-07-19T19:00:00-07:00", "track_id": 14, "user_ids": [37], "room_id": 9, "end_time": "2010-07-19T20:00:00-07:00", "id": 51}
