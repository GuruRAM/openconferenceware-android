{"description": "\n<p>In recent years significant capital has been invested in patent speculation and for the last two years, Congress has been discussing patent reform.</p>\n<p>Hedge funds in need of generating quick returns in this challenging market are seeking investments in patent trolls, aka non-practicing entities (NPEs). ScienceProgress.org reports that hundreds of NPEs have been formed, thousands of patent suits have been filed, and more than $5 billion has been invested in patent acquisitions by NPEs since 2003.</p>\n<p>At the same time, corporate entities have built large patent portfolios. This feeds patent aggression for corporate entities whose business models are hostile to true innovation. The resulting patent arms race is fueled by the existence of poor quality patents that are overly broad in claim scope, not new, and not non-obvious.  This is partially due to the fact that insufficient prior art was identified to enable rejection of poor quality patents by the <span class=\"caps\">USPTO</span>. \nAny changes made to the current laws are likely to be suboptimal without participation from the open source community in reforming the patent system.</p>\n<p>Keith Bergelt, <span class=\"caps\">CEO</span> of <span class=\"caps\">OIN</span>, a company formed by <span class=\"caps\">IBM</span>, NEC, Novell, Philips, Red Hat and Sony to protect Linux, will share his insights into the build-up and ramifications of the patent arms race for the open source community. He will discuss common legal pitfalls in this environment and provide open source companies and developers with tools and strategies that they can use to avoid these pitfalls.</p>\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; <strong>Sponsored by Open Invention Network</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n", "title": "Patents, Probes, and Strength in Unity: Protecting Innovation through Participation", "start_time": "2010-07-21T11:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 23, "user_ids": [711], "room_id": 24, "end_time": "2010-07-21T12:10:00-07:00", "id": 741}
