{"description": "\n<p>The Google Polling Place Locator project began in 2008, when in cooperation with the Pew Center of the States we developed the Voting Information Project and <span class=\"caps\">VIP</span> interchange format. In addition to helping States open up their data we provided the Polling Locator <span class=\"caps\">API</span> and embeddable gadgets for organizations and candidates to help their constituents know where to vote, who was on the ballot and how to find out if they were registered.</p>\n\n\nIn 2010 Google is continuing this project, working on helping more states open their data in both <span class=\"caps\">VIP</span> and other formats. This talk will give both an overview of the project and in-depth technical description of the <span class=\"caps\">API</span> and data sources, specifically addressing:\n\t\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; How to query the Polling Locator <span class=\"caps\">API</span><br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Where the data comes from<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; How States prepare, submit, and update data in both <span class=\"caps\">VIP</span> and other formats<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; How to access the open data for results reporting<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>Time permitting we&#8217;ll also discuss how we&#8217;re broadening the scope to international elections, and some of our trials and tribulations along the way.</p>\n", "title": "Open Election Information and The Google Polling Place Locator API", "start_time": "2010-07-22T11:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 22, "user_ids": [213], "room_id": 21, "end_time": "2010-07-22T12:10:00-07:00", "id": 222}
