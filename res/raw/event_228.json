{"description": "\n<p>Over the past four years, we have seen IT data center virtualization go mainstream and have started to realize the benefits promised by this transformation.  It&#8217;s only logical that we keep building on this momentum and start to stretch the legs of these new scalable, elastic computing infrastructures.  Enter cloud computing.</p>\n<p>Originally as part of a conceptual Building-A-Cloud workshop that I&#8217;ve created, this paper will describe the buildout of a Private Cloud infrastructure based entirely on open source software.  This fits in very nicely if you are an internal IT provider of a lab or research environment such as I am.  Economic drivers along with the need to very quickly provision and recycle IT resources lead us toward the clouds.</p>\n<p>Some of the more interesting benefits and challenges will be discussed as well as some of the future possibilities of open source private cloud computing.</p>\n", "title": "Deploying an Open Source Private Cloud On a Shoe String Budget", "start_time": "2010-07-22T11:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 13, "user_ids": [219], "room_id": 14, "end_time": "2010-07-22T12:10:00-07:00", "id": 228}
