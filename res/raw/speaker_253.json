I spend most of my time integrating new Rails applications with existing systems that use a toxic mixture of legacy technologies, such as Java, PL/SQL, <span class=\"caps\">PHP</span>, Lotus Notes/Domino, Visual Basic, etc., etc.\nAt night I like to indulge my passion for open source development; I enjoy both writing code and writing about code. At http://patshaughnessy.net I\u2019ve written articles about my own ideas, as well as a series of detailed tutorials geared towards Rails beginners. I find that often the best way to learn something is by writing about it.\nWhen I\u2019m not in front of a keyboard, I enjoy Spanish food, music and literature and travel to Spain frequently. I\u2019m also fluent in Spanish."}
