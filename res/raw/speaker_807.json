Since then, she&#8217;s done everything from customer service to product planning to documentation to user advocacy to QA testing to falling over exhausted because she&#8217;s trying to do too much at once. Denise lives in Baltimore, Maryland, <span class=\"caps\">USA</span> with her long-suffering girlfriend, who fortunately enjoys the frequent &#8220;c&#8217;mere, look, isn&#8217;t this cool?&#8221; invocations, and two cats, who don&#8217;t care about the internet as long as they get fed on time."}
