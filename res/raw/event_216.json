{"description": "\n<p>jQuery UI, built on top of jQuery, is a complete set of interactions and widgets for building Rich Internet Applications. A few examples include: drag-and-drop, resizing, mouse-sorting, mouse-selecting, autocomplete, button, datepicker, dialog, progressbar, slider, and tabs.</p>\n<p>Each component adheres to a consistent standard across <span class=\"caps\">API</span>, design, behavior and theming. This minimizes the surprise and makes learning all of them as easy as learning one. Just as with jQuery, there is a plugin system in jQuery UI that allows users to easily modify and extend existing components, as well as create your own.</p>\n<p>jQuery UI also includes a powerful and flexible <span class=\"caps\">CSS</span> framework. The jQuery <span class=\"caps\">UI CSS</span> Framework, the first <span class=\"caps\">CSS</span> framework to focus on UI widgets rather than web page design and layout, brings consistency to a web User Interface, while allowing developers of all levels of design experience to customize and tweak it to fit an existing or a new site design.</p>\n<p>This session covers how jQuery UI is designed and how it leverages the power, flexibility, and expressiveness of the jQuery <span class=\"caps\">API</span>. A live demonstration shows you how to use some of the more common jQuery UI behaviors and components, the jquery <span class=\"caps\">UI CSS</span> Framework, and ThemeRoller, the tool for building and customizing jQuery UI Themes.</p>\n", "title": "jQuery UI: Rich Interactivity, Simplified", "start_time": "2010-07-22T11:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 20, "user_ids": [65], "room_id": 7, "end_time": "2010-07-22T12:10:00-07:00", "id": 216}
