{"description": "\n<p>If you are responsible for the health of an open source development project, you may be considering using financial means to improve the dynamic in some way.  Perhaps you want to accelerate development, make the community more vibrant, or just thank people who have contributed a lot.  Hiring and assigning staff to solve problems is a traditional means of using money to help, but not the only method out there.  Bounties, awards programs, and contract work are all methods that are frequently employed by open source projects, especially projects that have a little money to spend, but maybe not enough to hire full-time staff.</p>\n<p>Financial motivations can be fraught with peril though.  Even a well-implemented program can produce poor results under many circumstances.  While a financial incentive may increase motivation for some, it might be demotivating for others.  Worse, some incentives even demotivate the person receiving them.</p>\n<p>This panel is made up of individuals with a broad range of experience in incentive programs, contract work, and community management.  We&#8217;ll talk about what works, what doesn&#8217;t work, and what to look out for when using money to spruce up a project.</p>\n", "title": "Financial Incentives in Open Source", "start_time": "2010-07-21T11:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 24, "user_ids": [57, 747, 753, 759, 765], "room_id": 14, "end_time": "2010-07-21T12:10:00-07:00", "id": 771}
