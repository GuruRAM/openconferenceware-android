{"description": "\n<p>Like hamburger &#38; fries and turkey &#38; dressing, JRuby allows you to harness the awesome power of Ruby in your Java projects. This session describes the origins, capabilities, and limitations of JRuby, the 100% pure-Java implementation of the Ruby programming language. It covers syntax, idioms, best practices, and ways that JRuby is alike and differs from other dynamic languages. This session also demonstrates some areas where it makes sense to mix Ruby and Java code: building swing applications, testing, and dynamic programming. This tutorial also shows tons of meta-programming techniques in JRuby, including open classes, eigen classes, defining methods, method_ &#38; const_missing, dynamically adding and removing mixins, and more. And each of these comes with an example that actually makes sense!</p>\n", "title": "Introduction to JRuby", "start_time": "2010-07-19T08:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 11, "user_ids": [171], "room_id": 12, "end_time": "2010-07-19T12:00:00-07:00", "id": 2025}
