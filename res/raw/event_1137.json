{"description": "\n<p>Open-source has made it possible for nearly anyone with a bit of development background to create a telecom application or add telecom functionality to a business process.  However, open source does not help developers make usable TUIs (telephony user interfaces ). Many of the IT or Web developers that are now attempting to telecom enable their applications would benefit from understanding the rules for good <span class=\"caps\">IVR</span> and telecom application interface design that were developed during the late eighties and early nineties.</p>\n<p>As it was in the early days of PC based telephony, many new developers risk creating nearly un-navigable <span class=\"caps\">DTMF</span> telephony interfaces to their applications.   This presentation will discuss the details of designing application interfaces that need to be used in a &#8220;listen only&#8221; mode.   This discussion will include good prompt design, application flow and menu design for both <span class=\"caps\">DTMF</span> and <span class=\"caps\">ASR</span> implementation.</p>\n", "title": "Open Source Telecommunications: Enabling Anyone to Build a Bad Telephony Application", "start_time": "2010-07-21T17:20:00-07:00", "track_id": 6, "user_ids": [1155], "room_id": 12, "end_time": "2010-07-21T18:00:00-07:00", "id": 1137}
