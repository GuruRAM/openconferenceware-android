{"description": "\n<p>When engaged in Free, Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) development, it is nearly impossible to avoid legal issues and concerns.  Every few lines of code written become subject to copyright.  Patents seem to cover nearly any code a developer can write.  Trademarks may already exist on potential project names for your exciting new codebase.</p>\n<p>In <span class=\"caps\">FLOSS</span> development, we&#8217;d all rather ignore these legal systems that impact our work, but we cannot.  In this talk, a lawyer and a software developer team up to introduce the basics of what every developer should know about these legal systems.  This presentation helps <span class=\"caps\">FLOSS</span> hackers understand the parts of these legal systems that are most likely to effect them, in hopes that they can go about their work armed with the right knowledge and keep the legal details from getting in their way.</p>\n<p>This talk will cover:</p>\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; What copyrights are, how to properly mark your project with a <span class=\"caps\">FLOSS</span> copyright license, and what issues should be considered when accepting copyrighted contributions from others.<br/>\n<br/>\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; How patents work, what a <span class=\"caps\">FLOSS</span> developer should know about them, and those areas of development where patents are of most concern.<br/>\n<br/>\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; The details to consider when a project considers a new name, and what issues to discuss with your co-developers when considering applying for trademark.<br/>\n<br/>\n", "title": "Bare Essentials of Legal Issues for Developers", "start_time": "2010-07-21T17:20:00-07:00", "track_id": 24, "user_ids": [1179, 1185], "room_id": 14, "end_time": "2010-07-21T18:00:00-07:00", "id": 1155}
