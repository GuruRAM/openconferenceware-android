{"description": "\n<p>Google&#8217;s released a huge amount of open source code. But we&#8217;ve heard from developers that it was a pain to create new releases of the actively-developed internal code. Make Open Easy is our response: tools and idioms to help maintain open source code that is embedded in a larger code base.</p>\n\n\nThe tools perform such tasks as:\n\t\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; push a codebase to a source control system<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; import changes made to the public codebase<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; maintain these slightly-different codebases in correspondence with each other<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; alert developers when there are changes waiting to be pushed<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>I&#8217;ll also show projects we&#8217;ve moved to this system, and how they&#8217;ve changed their development process in response.</p>\n", "title": "Make Open Easy", "start_time": "2010-07-23T11:50:00-07:00", "track_id": 3, "user_ids": [2007], "room_id": 21, "end_time": "2010-07-23T12:30:00-07:00", "id": 1989}
