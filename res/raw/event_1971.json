{"description": "\n<p>The <span class=\"caps\">DNS</span> Security protocols &#8211; codenamed <span class=\"caps\">DNSSEC</span> &#8211; were more than a decade in the making, and have been tested and re-tested and studied and documented. They work. They do the job. They make <span class=\"caps\">DNS</span> secure. Their use for critical government and enterprise infrastructure has been a good idea for several years now. For many government agencies, <span class=\"caps\">DNSSEC</span> deployment has become a mandate.</p>\n<p>Alas, <span class=\"caps\">DNSSEC</span> isn&#8217;t being used as much as it should, because it scares people. The problem is that <span class=\"caps\">DNSSEC</span> seems to be very complicated and the documentation sometimes feels like it should be part of the Tax Code.</p>\n<p><span class=\"caps\">ISC</span> is one of the leading experts on the deployment and use of <span class=\"caps\">DNSSEC</span>. We can teach you how to use it without novocaine. To use <span class=\"caps\">DNSSEC</span>, you need to digitally sign your <span class=\"caps\">DNS</span> data (your &#8220;zone&#8221;), and then provide a means by which a suspicious client computer can verify the signature. We&#8217;ll walk you through setting this up and turning it on.</p>\n", "title": "DNSSEC Exposed - Deploying DNSSEC in Real Life", "start_time": "2010-07-23T11:50:00-07:00", "track_id": 17, "user_ids": [1989], "room_id": 9, "end_time": "2010-07-23T12:30:00-07:00", "id": 1971}
