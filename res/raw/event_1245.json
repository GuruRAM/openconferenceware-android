{"description": "\n<p>From the <span class=\"caps\">GNU</span> Manifesto:</p>\n<p>The case of programs today is very different from that of books a hundred years ago. The fact that the easiest way to copy a program is from one neighbor to another, the fact that a program has both source code and object code which are distinct, and the fact that a program is used rather than read and enjoyed, combine to create a situation in which a person who enforces a copyright is harming society as a whole both materially and spiritually; in which a person should not do so regardless of whether the law enables him to.</p>\n<p>Yet, the tactics that the free software, (the the open source software) communities embraced were to licencse software.  The very definition of open source software is related to the license&#8212;not the software.  And this focus on legal issues generates fear in businesses, which avoid adopting open source software because of concerns and misunderstandings about the licenses.</p>\n<p>Open Source software has grown up.  We don&#8217;t need licenses.  It is time to implement Richard Stallman&#8217;s original vision&#8212;software should be unlicensed; it should be in the public domain.</p>\n", "title": "License to Fail", "start_time": "2010-07-22T10:40:00-07:00", "track_id": 10, "user_ids": [867], "room_id": 20, "end_time": "2010-07-22T11:20:00-07:00", "id": 1245}
