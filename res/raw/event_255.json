{"description": "\n<p>Flashcache is a simple Block Level Cache for Linux implemented at Facebook. It is built as a loadable kernel module, as a Device Mapper client. It supports both write back and write through caching modes. Flashcache is pushed onto the storage stack under the filesystem, with the intent of caching disk blocks on SSDs. Linux kernels from 2.6.18 to 2.6.32 are supported. The code is available for download on GitHub.</p>\n<p>Flashcache enables the use of a flash device as a persistent cache of filesystem data. This can significantly reduce disk IO latency for IO bound applications. We will describe the use of Flashcache to improve MySQL performance, present benchmark results and describe its impact on operations.</p>\n<p><strong>Sponsored by Facebook</strong></p>\n", "title": "Flashcache", "start_time": "2010-07-22T14:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 23, "user_ids": [244, 245], "room_id": 24, "end_time": "2010-07-22T15:10:00-07:00", "id": 255}
