{"description": "\n<p>The goal of this tutorial is to get started and get productive with Grails.  We&#8217;ll do this by jumping right in and building an application, from design to deployment.</p>\n<p>Rather than try to learn Grails feature by feature, we&#8217;ll let it unfold as we build the application.  We&#8217;ll begin with a simple application structure that runs right out of the box, then we&#8217;ll gradually build our application while building our knowledge of Grails.</p>\n\n\nWhen we&#8217;re done, you&#8217;ll have learned about:\n\t\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Grails Domain Classes<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Dynamic scaffolding<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Grails Controllers<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Groovy Server Pages <br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; <span class=\"caps\">GSP</span> Tags<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Grails Object Relational Mapping (GORM)<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Dynamically Injected Service Classes<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Grails&#8217; Javascript and Ajax Support<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; <span class=\"caps\">URL</span> Mapping<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>This is an introduction, but it is also a deep dive. So come prepared to code and to learn.</p>\n", "title": "Grails: Bringing Radical Productivity to the JVM", "start_time": "2010-07-20T13:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 11, "user_ids": [69], "room_id": 7, "end_time": "2010-07-20T17:00:00-07:00", "id": 82}
