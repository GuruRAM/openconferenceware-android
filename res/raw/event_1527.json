{"description": "\n<p>Efficient IT infrastructures must hold to several basic properties. Changes must be tracked. Automation must be maximized. Compliance against corporate standards must be preserved. Nowhere is this more important than in the day of the ever expanding cloud.</p>\n<p>While it has often been typical to manage disparate systems in an ad hoc way, with a variety of home-grown tools and shell scripts, we are quickly evolving into a IT environment of sufficient complexity that modeling the computing environment is required to tame it. In this session, Michael DeHaan, Product Manager for Reductive Labs, will go over these concepts from a tool-agnostic perspective, and also share how tools like Puppet, version control, and other management tools, can be used on datacenter infrastructure to achieve these properties and move your infrastructure management towards a more predictable and flexible state.</p>\n<p>Technical information will include Puppet examples, best practices, as well as tips for systems administrations and IT leaders alike in developing their own Agile Infrastructure.  We&#8217;ll also take a look at the future of systems management, and new features coming in Puppet. Audience members will leave with an understanding of infrastructure modeling, best practices, the future of the IT ecosystem, and ways to take their infrastructure to the next level.</p>\n", "title": "Datacenter Automation with Puppet", "start_time": "2010-07-22T14:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 17, "user_ids": [1551], "room_id": 9, "end_time": "2010-07-22T15:10:00-07:00", "id": 1527}
