While working as a full-time Technologist for a defence contractor Russ also completed writing 2 books (&#8220;AspectJ Cookbook&#8221;, &#8220;Learning <span class=\"caps\">UML 2</span>.0&#8221; for O&#8217;Reilly Media) and obtained a BSc and then an MSc in Software Engineering from Oxford University. This multi-tasking tendency (or &#8220;gift/curse&#8221;, depending on how you look at it) has enabled Russ to gain a huge amount of experience working in a diverse collection of industry sectors."}
