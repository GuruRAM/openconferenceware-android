{"description": "\n<p>This tutorial will briefly introduce Gearman, and then go into a series of detailed use cases that show how to build various types of distributed applications. Examples will include:</p>\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Map/Reduce style problems<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Pipeline processing<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Scatter/gather queries<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Asynchronous queuing of tasks<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>Armed with the distributed architectures and examples from this tutorial, developers will be able to integrate the same concepts into custom applications. This knowledge can greatly benefit those building scale-out, fault tolerant, and/or cloud based solutions.</p>\n<p>Code will be presented in a variety of languages including <span class=\"caps\">PHP</span>, Python, and C, but the concepts can be applied to any language <span class=\"caps\">API</span>. Previous knowledge of Gearman will be helpful, but not required.</p>\n", "title": "The Gearman Cookbook", "start_time": "2010-07-19T13:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 13, "user_ids": [33, 34], "room_id": 12, "end_time": "2010-07-19T17:00:00-07:00", "id": 47}
