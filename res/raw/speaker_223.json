He runs the Cloud Languages Team in the Business Platform Division at Microsoft, where his primary focus has been to remove the impedance mismatch between databases and programming languages in the context of the Cloud. One of the fruits of these efforts is <span class=\"caps\">LINQ</span>, which not only adds a native querying syntax to .NET languages, such as C# and Visual Basic, but also allows developers to query data sources other than tables, such as objects or <span class=\"caps\">XML</span>. Most recently, Erik has been working on \u201cDemocratizing the Cloud\u201d and preaching the virtues of fundamentalist functional programming in the new age of concurrency and many-core. Some people might recognize him from his brief stint as the &#8220;Head in the Box&#8221; on Microsoft <span class=\"caps\">VBTV</span>. These days, you can regularly watch Erik\u2019s interviews on the \u201cExpert-to-Expert\u201d and \u201cGoing Deep\u201d series on Channel 9."}
