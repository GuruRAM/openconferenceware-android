{"description": "\n<p>Water parameters are hard to measure because water is hard to get to.  It&#8217;s underwater, and water is a strong solvent. Water parameters are interesting to us because we are mostly water. Using inexpensive sensors and an Arduino (compatible) we can measure those water parameters, such as temperature, turbidity and salinity. We can log those changes over time, and correlate them with the tides, or the time of day. With a log, we can look for changes in the water that affect public health.  With a network of these sensors, pollutants can be tracked through the water channel. There the sweet water in Mahim Creek in Mumbai, India several years ago? A salinity test could have said whether that was actually sweet water, or merely differently polluted water.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll show how to measure temperature, turbidity, and salinity of water using the A/D on the Arduino, and control a <span class=\"caps\">LED</span>. Will explain the concept of a voltage divider. Will run through the C source code that reads the sensors and controls the <span class=\"caps\">LED</span>.</p>\n", "title": "Environmental Monitoring with Arduino and Compatibles", "start_time": "2010-07-21T17:20:00-07:00", "track_id": 12, "user_ids": [1137], "room_id": 9, "end_time": "2010-07-21T18:00:00-07:00", "id": 1113}
