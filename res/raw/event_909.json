{"description": "\n<p>The Texas Instruments-designed single-board computer known as the Beagle Board provides netbook-like performance for under 2 watts.  Designed as an <span class=\"caps\">OMAP3430</span>-based development platform, the Beagle contains the same <span class=\"caps\">ARM</span> Cortex-A8 processor as many modern smartphones and devices in an inexpensive package.  Its accessibility makes it a boon to embedded Linux developers and a powerful elixir to hobbyists.  Moreover, the hardware design itself is open-source, making it possible for developers to change the design and invent new derivative boards with special purposes.</p>\n<p>This presentation demonstrates how to boot three different distributions, including:</p>\n<p>- Android, a popular Linux-based OS\n- Angstrom, an embedded Linux distribution\n- MontaVista Linux, a commercial embedded Linux distribution</p>\n<p>It also showcases several ongoing open-source projects based on the Beagle Board, gives an overview of the process of designing your own, and introduces the Beagle Board community.</p>\n", "title": "How to Boot Linux on the Beagle Board", "start_time": "2010-07-21T14:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 12, "user_ids": [903], "room_id": 9, "end_time": "2010-07-21T15:10:00-07:00", "id": 909}
