{"description": "\n<p>Massive growth in the size of business datasets leads many companies to Hadoop, an emerging architecture for parallel data processing (and top-level Apache project). However, the migration path can be challenging, in part because MapReduce analyses use programming languages like Java and Python rather than <span class=\"caps\">SQL</span>. Apache Pig is a high-level framework built on top of Hadoop that offers a powerful yet vastly simplified way to analyze data in Hadoop. It allows businesses to leverage the power of Hadoop in a simple language readily learnable by anyone that understands <span class=\"caps\">SQL</span>. In this presentation, I will introduce Pig and show how it&#8217;s been used at Twitter to solve numerous analytics challenges that became intractable with our former MySQL-based architecture.</p>\n", "title": "Hadoop, Pig, and Twitter", "start_time": "2010-07-22T14:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 4, "user_ids": [250], "room_id": 14, "end_time": "2010-07-22T15:10:00-07:00", "id": 259}
