My first professional project started by rewriting the specification of a configuration software for a <span class=\"caps\">PABX</span> (the machine used to manage company phones) for 6 (six!) months. From there, I&#8217;ve been developing software for various industries (telecom, finance, pharmaceutical), always amazed by the mysterious process of translating requirements to executable code. After spending lots of efforts trying to model software with <span class=\"caps\">UML</span>, I understood that I first needed a deep dive into the primary material of a developer, its programming language (PL). Scala gave me an incredible opportunity to learn both PL theory and practice but also to give back to others in the form of Open Source software."}
