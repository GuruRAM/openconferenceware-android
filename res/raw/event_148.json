{"description": "\n<p>Ur/Web is a new domain-specific language for programming Web applications, based on a new general-purpose language called Ur. Ur features new abstraction and modularity features that make serious code reuse and metaprogramming possible within a strong static type system. Adam will give the lightning-speed pitches for these two kinds of features: components with strong encapsulation of state like database tables, cookies, and subtrees of the <span class=\"caps\">DOM</span>; and compile-time type-directed programming, with strong static guarantees of good behavior.</p>\n", "title": "Ur", "start_time": "2010-07-21T14:00:00-07:00", "track_id": 2, "user_ids": [134], "room_id": 23, "end_time": "2010-07-21T14:20:00-07:00", "id": 148}
