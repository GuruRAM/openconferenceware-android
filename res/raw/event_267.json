{"description": "\n<p>Much of the power of <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span>, the <span class=\"caps\">GNU</span> Image Manipulation program, comes from its plug-in architecture. Most of the functions you use in <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span>, including everything in the Filters menu, are plug-ins.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial, you&#8217;ll learn to write your own <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> plug-ins in two languages: Script-fu and Python.</p>\n<p>Script-Fu is <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span>&#8217;s native language, installed in every version of <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span>.  Script-fu is a variant of Scheme, but you don&#8217;t need to be fluent in Scheme or Lisp to write Script-fu.  You just need to know a few basics of Lisp syntax and how to find the right <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> call to do what you need.  I&#8217;ll also cover some of the script-fu changes introduced in 2.4, how to update older scripts, and how to make sure your new scripts will run on all <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> versions.</p>\n<p>The second half of the tutorial will cover Python, rapidly becoming the language of choice for <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span> plug-ins because of its flexibility and clean <span class=\"caps\">API</span>.  You&#8217;ll see how Python&#8217;s access to raw pixel data in an image gives it a huge advantage over Script-fu, and how you can use Python-GTK to create user interfaces far beyond <span class=\"caps\">GIMP</span>&#8217;s usual plug-in dialogs.</p>\n<p>If possible, bring a laptop with <span class=\"caps\">GIMP 2</span>.6 and Python installed.  You&#8217;ll have a chance to write your own plug-ins and try them for yourself.</p>\n", "title": "Writing GIMP Plug-ins and Scripts", "start_time": "2010-07-22T16:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 5, "user_ids": [257], "room_id": 10, "end_time": "2010-07-22T17:10:00-07:00", "id": 267}
