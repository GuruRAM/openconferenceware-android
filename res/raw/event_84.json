{"description": "\n<p>Google Wave is a product that helps users communicate and collaborate on the web. A &#8220;wave&#8221; is equal parts conversation and document, where users can almost instantly communicate and work together with richly formatted text, photos, videos, maps, and more. Google Wave is also a platform with a rich set of open APIs that allow developers to embed waves in other web services and to build extensions that work inside waves.</p>\n<p>Wave extensions are a way to augment the functionality of waves and the wave client. Robots are one kind of extension Robots are applications which can be added to waves as automated wave participants. Robot extensions commonly automate tasks, but can also participate in the wave as a participant, interacting with the conversation based on their capabilities.</p>\n<p>This hands on tutorial will walk you through the steps of building a Wave robot, from setting up the Python client library through to using the major APIs that Wave provides.</p>\n<h4>Detailed Outline</h4>\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Intro to Wave&#8212;Overview of Google Wave and it&#8217;s capabilities.
