{"description": "\n<p>There is a global consensus that integrated electronic health records are essential to improving health outcomes, providing better quality of care, insuring patient safety, and reducing costs. Unfortunately, the healthcare software industry has yet to produce effective clinical and administrative solutions which are desperately needed worldwide. Recent high profile failures in the UK and Canada will be cited as hard lessons to be heeded.The lesson for <span class=\"caps\">ARRA</span> funding is pouring more money into the same approaches and solutions will continue to yield the same results.</p>\n<p>The <span class=\"caps\">FOSS</span> model brings the kind of fundamental paradigm shift that is essential to catalyzing real change. Based on 12 years applying open source strategy in healthcare, the session will explore real world examples of how <span class=\"caps\">FOSS</span> can drive clinical transformation in health systems. In particular the experience in the US Veterans Administration with the VistA <span class=\"caps\">EHR</span> software will be examined. The session will also describe how some developing countries such as Jordan are building on this experience to leapfrog the &#8220;Tower of Babel&#8221; e-health infrastructures that have paralyzed healthcare in the developed world. Where and how prospective <span class=\"caps\">FOSS</span> contributors can best leverage their talents will be highlighted.</p>\n", "title": "Evidence Based Software Evolution or How Health Systems Can Heal Themselves", "start_time": "2010-07-22T11:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 25, "user_ids": [218], "room_id": 16, "end_time": "2010-07-22T11:50:00-07:00", "id": 227}
