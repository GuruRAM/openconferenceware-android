{"description": "\n<p>Community is a fluid concept that readily crosses competitive boundaries, as evidenced by the numerous hardware and software communities sponsored by vendors or established in open-source venues.  However, there is no central point.  Where can I go if I have a question or just want to listen to the questions of others?  How do I even go about finding out whom to ask?</p>\n<p>Since all developers are members of different communities, this BoF is open to everyone.  The discussion topic is how to make &#8220;the embedded Linux community&#8221; as a whole more approachable and easier to navigate for both the beginner and the experienced developer, project manager, support engineer, or technical writer.</p>\n", "title": "Embedded Linux Community BoF", "start_time": "2010-07-21T19:00:00-07:00", "track_id": 10, "user_ids": [139], "room_id": 19, "end_time": "2010-07-21T20:00:00-07:00", "id": 194}
