Then you need to take a look at <a href=\"http://gpars.codehaus.org/\">GPars</a> (&#8220;Jeepers!&#8221;), a library providing support for concurrency and parallelism in Groovy.  GPars brings powerful concurrency models from other languages to Groovy and makes them easy to use with custom DSLs:</p>\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Actors (Erlang and Scala)<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Dataflow (Io)<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Fork/join (Java)<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Safe (Clojure agents)<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>In addition to this support, GPars integrates with standard Groovy frameworks like Grails and Griffon.</p>\n<p>Background, comparisons to other languages, and motivating examples will be given for the major GPars features.</p>\n", "title": "GPars - Groovy Concurrency", "start_time": "2010-07-21T11:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 11, "user_ids": [699], "room_id": 20, "end_time": "2010-07-21T12:10:00-07:00", "id": 723}
