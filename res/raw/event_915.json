{"description": "\n<p>Running one of the worlds largest open source services is hard, but it is something that we at Google believe adds a lot of value. This talk will take you through my journey of working with several open source veterans as we built such a service at Google and the benefit we regularly get from a thriving open source community.</p>\n<p>In particular, as someone that was indoctrinated at Microsoft, I will describe some of the decisions we made that originally seemed counter-intuitive to me. These are a few decisions that would have been hard to make for most traditional companies.</p>\n<p>I will then go over some issues we face on a daily basis and talk about the questionable projects that people try to host. Some of the issues I will talk about are clearly easy to deal with, but we will quickly get to issues that have no clear right or wrong answer. I describe the approach we take in such cases.</p>\n<p>All the issues I bring up, big and small, are key part of managing a thriving open source community. By openly discussing these issues, I hope to spark a conversation about how to better handle these challenges and improve participation in these communities.</p>\n", "title": "Challenges of running Google Code - Porn, Malware, Hacks, etc.", "start_time": "2010-07-21T14:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 10, "user_ids": [909], "room_id": 10, "end_time": "2010-07-21T15:10:00-07:00", "id": 915}
