{"description": "\n<p>Perl&#8217;s system for object-orientation is powerful, turning over control of\nnearly everything to the programmer.  It abides by Perl&#8217;s motto, &#8220;There&#8217;s more\nthan one way to do it!&#8221;  The Moose philosophy agrees, but pencils in its own\nammendment, &#8220;There is more than one way to do it, but sometimes consistency is\nnot a bad thing either.&#8221;  By establishing a common system for building classes,\nMoose enables new levels of code reuse, allowing you to improve your code with\nfeatures that would otherwise be too complex or expensive to implement on your\nown.</p>\n<p>Although its compact, declarative look can seem perplexing at first glance,\nMoose is just Perl, and can be easily explained, learned, understood, and put\nto use.  This tutorial will cover all of Moose&#8217;s basic features, including\nattributes, subclassing, method modifiers, roles, and types.</p>\n", "title": "Moose is Perl: A Guide to the New Revolution", "start_time": "2010-07-19T13:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 8, "user_ids": [225], "room_id": 13, "end_time": "2010-07-19T17:00:00-07:00", "id": 219}
