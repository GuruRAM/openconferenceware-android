{"description": "\n<p>Scala is fast becoming the &#8220;next Java&#8221; in the eyes of many leaders in the Java world. Besides it&#8217;s powerful integration of the object-oriented and functional programming paradigms, it has strong capabilities for integrating with existing Java code. One very effective mechanism for bringing Scala into your environment is to use it for exploring the capabilities of Java libraries. Every experienced Java developer understands the pain of setting up the scaffolding needed to try out a new library (not to mention the well known &#8220;dependency hell&#8221; that comes along for the ride). With Scala and the tools available with it, you can reduce this pain by orders of magnitude. This talk will briefly introduce Scala and Simple Build Tool and then move on to show you how to quickly get started integrating Java libraries and exploring them in code. Through these examples, you will also learn how make use of Scala alongside your existing code.</p>\n", "title": "Harnessing Java with Scala", "start_time": "2010-07-21T10:40:00-07:00", "track_id": 11, "user_ids": [96, 97], "room_id": 20, "end_time": "2010-07-21T11:20:00-07:00", "id": 112}
