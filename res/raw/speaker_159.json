In this light he created the <a href=\"http://www.transterpreter.org/\">Transterpreter</a>, a small virtual machine for embedded parallel programming. Christian now works on the <a href=\"http://concurrency.cc/\">Plumbing</a> framework, a set of components that can be used to introduce parallel programming on embedded devices to novices. When not working on those things, he teaches at the department of <a href=\"http://www.diku.dk/\">Computer Science</a> at the <a href=\"http://www.ku.dk/English/\">University of Copenhagen</a>."}
