{"description": "\n<p>It&#8217;s all too common for IT organizations to become compartmentalized. Each segment of the organization develops tunnel vision around their particular tasks and biases around their own tooling. For today&#8217;s fast-paced web businesses, the inability to effectively orchestrate all of it&#8217;s increasingly dynamic parts leads to slow and unreliable operations.</p>\n<p>This presentation will examine, through examples of actual high performing organizations, what &#8220;well orchestrated operations&#8221; means and what it takes to achieve.  We&#8217;ll examine both the cultural and tooling requirements as well as the necessary measurements for success.</p>\n<p>1.
