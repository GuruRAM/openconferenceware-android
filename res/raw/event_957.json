{"description": "\n<p>Frink is a practical programming language and calculating tool\ndesigned to make physical calculations simple.  It tracks units of\nmeasure through all calculations, ensuring that answers are correct.\nBack-of-the-envelope calculations become trivial, and more complex\nphysical and engineering calculations become simpler to write and read,\nand allow transparent use of any units of measure.\n\n\t</p><p>Frink is also a full-fledged programming language that can perform</p>\n\nsymbolic mathematics, solve systems of equations, process text, do\nobject-oriented programming, perform date/time mathematics, do interval\narithmetic, interface with Java programs, and generally make your life\neasier and make you look smarter.\n", "title": "Frink", "start_time": "2010-07-21T14:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 2, "user_ids": [957], "room_id": 33, "end_time": "2010-07-21T14:50:00-07:00", "id": 957}
