He has an extensive background working professionally (11+ years) with <span class=\"caps\">HTML</span>, CSS, JavaScript, Flash, and client-side performance techniques as it pertains to web development. If he is not wielding client-side code he is likely toying with interface/interaction design, <span class=\"caps\">PHP</span>, MVC frameworks, iPhone development, jQuery, Dojo, or authoring material and speaking at various conferences. When not sitting in front of a computer, it&#8217;s a sure bet he is hanging out with his wife &#38; kids in Boise, Idaho, training for triathlons, skiing, mountain biking, road biking, alpine climbing, reading, watching movies, or debating the rational evidence for a Christian worldview. Currently he is working as a contractor/freelancer."}
