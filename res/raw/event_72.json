{"description": "\n<p>We believe that writing correct concurrent, fault-tolerant and scalable applications is too hard. Most of the time it&#8217;s because we are using the wrong tools and the wrong level of abstraction. Akka is here to change that. Akka is using the Actor Model together with Software Transactional Memory (STM) to raise the abstraction level and provide a better platform to build correct concurrent and scalable applications. For fault-tolerance it adopts the &#8220;Let it crash&#8221; model which have been used with great success in the Telecom industry to build applications that self-heals, systems that never stop. Akka&#8217;s Remote Actors, backed by a scalable non-blocking IO implementation, provides the abstraction for transparent distribution and the basis for truly scalable and fault-tolerant applications. In this talk you will learn what Akka is, how it can be used to solve hard problems and the ideas behind its design and implementation.
