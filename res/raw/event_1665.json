{"description": "\n<p>Mahout is an open source machine learning library from Apache. At the moment it means collaborative filtering / recommender engines, clustering, and classification.</p>\n<p>Mahout aims to be the machine learning tool of choice when the data to be processed is very large, perhaps far too large for a single machine. In its current incarnation, these scalable implementations are written in Java, and some portions are built upon Apache&#8217;s Hadoop distributed computation project.</p>\n<p>Mahout does not provide a user interface, a pre-packaged server, or installer. It is a framework of tools intended to be used and adapted by developers.</p>\n", "title": "Mahout: Mammoth Scale Machine Learning", "start_time": "2010-07-22T16:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 13, "user_ids": [1701], "room_id": 14, "end_time": "2010-07-22T17:10:00-07:00", "id": 1665}
