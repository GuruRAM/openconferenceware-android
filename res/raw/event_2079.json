{"description": "\n<p><span class=\"caps\">FOSS</span> code is developed in a radically transparent, participative, community-based manner &#8211; &#8220;the open source way&#8221; &#8211; which produces spectacular code. But these same <span class=\"caps\">FOSS</span> projects are usually marketed traditionally, behind closed doors. What if we applied the principles of open source participation to the marketing of open source itself?</p>\n<p>What does &#8220;Open Marketing&#8221; mean? How does it affect what you do?
