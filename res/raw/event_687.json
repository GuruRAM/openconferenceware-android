Both were very large sites with much history and existing content. And both had very tight deadlines. The redeveloped MichaelMoore.com is a social, news-based site in the top 10,000 US sites when launched. It has integrated search using Lucene/SOLR, a suite of administrative tools to add new content, organize it, and arrange it flexibly on the home page, and it has multiple web &#38; database servers.</p>\n<p>The Santa Fe Institute&#8217;s website (<a href=\"http://www.santafe.edu\">santafe.edu</a>) starts with DjangoCMS, a host of custom <span class=\"caps\">CMS</span> plugins, a robust schema, and integration with Alfresco, an iCal Server, and a Google Search appliance.</p>\n<p>This presentation will cover the variety of techniques, libraries, and best-practices used in developing and migrating content \u2013 and achieving such extreme timeline goals.</p>\n", "title": "Django: Two Extreme Case Studies", "start_time": "2010-07-21T11:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 5, "user_ids": [663, 669], "room_id": 6, "end_time": "2010-07-21T12:10:00-07:00", "id": 687}
