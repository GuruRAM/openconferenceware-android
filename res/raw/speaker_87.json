Oliver Chair for <span class=\"caps\">SETI</span> (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) and is Director of the Center for <span class=\"caps\">SETI</span> Research at the <span class=\"caps\">SETI</span> Institute in Mountain View, California.  Tarter received her Bachelor of Engineering Physics Degree with Distinction from Cornell University and her Master\u2019s Degree and a Ph.D. in Astronomy from the University of California, Berkeley.  She served as Project Scientist for <span class=\"caps\">NASA</span>\u2019s <span class=\"caps\">SETI</span> program, the High Resolution Microwave Survey, and has conducted numerous observational programs at radio observatories worldwide.  Since the termination of funding for <span class=\"caps\">NASA</span>\u2019s <span class=\"caps\">SETI</span> program in 1993, she has served in a leadership role to secure private funding to continue this exploratory science.  Currently, she serves on the management board for the Allen Telescope Array, a joint project between the <span class=\"caps\">SETI</span> Institute and the UC Berkeley Radio Astronomy Laboratory.  When this innovative array of 350 6-m antennas begins operations at the UC\u2019s Hat Creek Radio Observatory, it will simultaneously survey the radio universe for known and unexpected sources of astrophysical emissions, and speed up the search for radio emissions from other distant technologies by orders of magnitude."}
