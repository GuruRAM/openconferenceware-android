{"description": "\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.androidcookbook.com/\">Android Cookbook</a> will be full of how-to information along with code snippets that illustrate the ideas presented. Unlike most books that are written by one, two or a few individuals, this will have input from hundreds of contributors, who will be able to view and comment on each others&#8217; recipes before the book is printed. And after the book is printed, this site will continue to exist &#8211; with a larger collection of recipes than will fit in the printed book &#8211; and serve as an Android developer resource site long after.</p>\n<p>The <span class=\"caps\">BOF</span> will briefly explain the motivation for doing the book this way and the technology behind the scenes. But the main focus will be to get people contributing what they&#8217;ve learned about Android development to help other Android developers around the world.</p>\n", "title": "Crowdsourcing the Android Cookbook", "start_time": "2010-07-22T19:00:00-07:00", "track_id": 14, "user_ids": [2169], "room_id": 24, "end_time": "2010-07-22T20:00:00-07:00", "id": 2109}
