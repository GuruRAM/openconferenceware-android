{"description": "\n<p>Both open source and open data are based on licensing that supports user rights, a belief in transparency, and the power of distributed community.  Although open data as a movement is still in its infancy, the lessons learnt from open source and its increasing acceptance in the technical community are helping the open data movement gain rapid uptake.</p>\n<p>The last few years have brought an unprecedented number of new open data initiatives, ranging from open government in many countries, to museums and archives opening up their collections, to online services providing APIs and encouraging data analysis and mashups.  At the same time, the Semantic Web is moving beyond the abstract and into reality, with the web of Linked Open Data growing rapidly from month to month, and there are an ever-increasing variety of open source tools for creating or consuming open data, from handy browser plugins to serious number crunching software.</p>\n<p>This talk will be an overview of the open data world and how open source developers can be part of it. We&#8217;ll take a tour of some of the major open data projects, learn about open source tools to access and manipulate open data, and check out some of the best applications to come out of the intersection between the two communities.</p>\n", "title": "Open Source, Open Data", "start_time": "2010-07-22T11:30:00-07:00", "track_id": 22, "user_ids": [615], "room_id": 21, "end_time": "2010-07-22T12:10:00-07:00", "id": 627}
